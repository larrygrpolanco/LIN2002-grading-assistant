    "student_essay": "I found the movie The Perfect Secret very interesting, which made me want to watch more. I even watched it more than once because I began to notice small details that indicated there were secrets between all of the friends from the very beginning. For example, the earrings Simon gave to Eva, or the photos Rocco received at the beginning, may have been related to his profession as a plastic surgeon. However, this is never fully explained, even though he is shown with a second cellphone at the end of the movie.\n\nI find this topic and theme universal because cellphones are such an important part of our daily lives. Eva, who is a psychologist, mentions this idea at 17 minutes and 20 seconds into the movie, explaining that our phones contain GPS data, search history, blogs, messages, photos, location information, and personal details. This is when she states that everyone has something to hide and proposes a game called \u201cComing Clean.\u201d\n\nI found this relatable because most relationships are built on trust, but nobody is perfect, and some people do have things they keep hidden. Many relationships end because a partner searches the other\u2019s phone and finds something unsettling. I also found this personally relatable because my wife and I have access to each other\u2019s phones and have searched through them in the past. However, after many years, we grew to trust one another and slowly stopped doing that. We now have no problem with the other person using our phone, and have nothing to hide.\n\nOverall, this movie sheds light on how people behave in the world today and how dependent we are on technology, especially our cellphones. It shows what could happen if someone took our phone and decided to go through it. Whether it is a friend, partner, or a stranger, the information on our devi",

    "student_essay": "To be honest, I had to watch The Perfect Secret not once, but twice. The first time, I\nwas not interested in the movie and had to take a break for two days. I didn't really give it a\nchance, but the second time around, I decided to take notes and really try and focus on the\ncharacters, and wow, did I make a mistake the first time! I fell in love with Bianca; from the\nmoment she talked to Pepe out on the patio about how to know if you are in love. She had\nsuch an open mind and was such a sweetheart. She was definitely too good for Simon in\nmy opinion. I thought it was very interesting how Eva wanted to play this game, I knew from\nthe start it was just to see if her husband had been cheating on her, but I don't think she\nrealized how big of a mess she would create. From Carlotta\u2019s phone call with her friend\nMouse talking about her and Leo\u2019s nonexistent sex life (Video 1 at 43 minutes and 05\nseconds till Video 2 at 2 minutes and 29 seconds), all the way to Leo and Pepe switching\nphones so Leo wouldn't get caught with his \u201ccompanion\u201d, as he calls her (Video 1 at 40\nminutes and 11 seconds) , and Pepe having to announce to all his friends that he was gay.\n(Video 3 in 2 minutes, 55 seconds). I think why almost every culture can relate to this movie\nis because everyone has secrets that hide from friends, family, and loved ones. Pepe was\nhiding a huge part of himself from his friends because of the fear that they wouldn't accept\nhim or even like him anymore, and for a moment he was right in feeling that way. All three\nof his friends, Rocco, Leo, and Simon, used hurtful language, and really made Pepe feel\nuncomfortable with whom he is as a gay person (Video 2 at 34 minutes and 18 seconds). I\nam glad that, at the end, the three boys made it up to Pepe by beating up the man who has\nbeen sending hateful messages to him and became friends again. I think in every culture\nwe need to be honest and communicate with our friends and loved ones to avoid chaos\nand drama, and to support them and love them for who they are.",

    "student_essay": "This film covers a range of topics and themes such as homophobia, infidelity, and\nthe nature of friendship, and due to these topics it is adapted in more than 18 languages\nacross different cultures. The film shows how a group of friends sit at a dinner table and\nexplore their hidden secret. It shows how little the friends and romantic partners know\neach other and how all their secrets are hidden in their phones. The film is able to be\nadapted into multiple cultures because of its simplicity. The film was able to cover a\nseries of topics simply in the setting of friends at a dinner table playing a game. At the\ncore of the story is the idea that our smartphones hold our most private thoughts,\nconversations, and secrets. Since smartphones are now an essential part of daily life\nacross the world, the fear of having one's digital life exposed is something audiences\nfrom many cultural backgrounds can immediately relate to.\nThe topic also resonates universally because infidelity, trust, and secrecy are\nfundamental issues in both romantic relationships and friendships. While different\ncultures may have different cultural norms regarding privacy or relationships, nearly all\npeople understand the tension between wanting to be fully known and wanting to\nprotect a certain part of themselves. The dinner-table setting reinforces this universality\nas sharing a meal with close friends, showing how intimate and realistic the situation is,\nallowing the story to be easily adapted to different cultural contexts without losing its\nimpact.\nThere are multiple scenes that can be true for all relationships. For instance, at 42\nminutes and 17 seconds, Carlotta gets a call from her childhood where she begins to\ngive advice on how to improve Carlotta's sex life with Leo. As a woman, this is relatively\nrelatable as I tell my girlfriends everything. In almost every friendship I've had with\nanother woman it is normal to open up about everything including more private things.\nSo, I believe this scene wonderfully demonstrates female friendships. Even after\nCarlotta ends the conversation with her friend she doesn\u2019t really show shame but rather\nsays \u201cyes, surprise I talk to my best friend about our sex life\u201d demonstrating the lack of\njudgment and the deep trust that can exist in close friendships. This moment also shows\nhow different female relationships are in comparison to male friendships considering\nLeo was very shocked by how comfortable she was to talk to her best friend about\nprivate matters.\nAnother scene is at 29 minutes and 10 seconds of the second clip. Leo and Pepe\nswitched phones so Carlotta wouldn\u2019t find out about Leo\u2019s affair. However that soon\nbackfires because Pepe was hiding a secret about being homosexual. The scene erupts\ninto a huge misunderstanding where Carlotta believes her husband, Leo is gay.\nHowever despite Pepe and Leo both knowing the truth of the situation, Leo refuses to\nexpose Pepe. This shows how deep the trust goes within their friendship. Leo\u2019s\nmarriage was on the verge of collapsing but he refused to admit the truth only to defend\nand protect his close friend. I believe it's fair to say that this scene can be shown across\nall friendships, because in all friendships trust runs deep and it demonstrates how\nfriends have each other's backs no matter the situation.\nOverall, the film \u201cPerfect Secret\u201d shows that simple settings can explore universal truths\nabout relationships. Through the dinner-table game and the revelations in scenes with\nCarlotta and Leo, the film highlights trust, secrecy, and loyalty in both friendships and\nromantic partnerships. These experiences are relatable across cultures, which is why\nthe story has been adapted into so many languages. The film demonstrates that,\ndespite cultural differences, the complexities of human relationships are truly universal.",

    "feedback": "Hi Kseniya, great job analyzing the film's gender dynamics. Your point about Carlotta was excellent: the universality here is that female friendships often involve a level of disclosure that men find shocking. \n\nHowever, you need to be much more concise. You exceeded the maximum word count by a wide margin. You have two introductory paragraphs that say essentially the same thing. You could combine these into one. \n\nAdditionally, please proofread for phrasing and punctuation. In terms of phrasing, for example, you wrote \"Carlotta gets a call from her childhood....\" You likely meant \"from her childhood friend.\" For punctuation, watch your commas. \"However that soon backfires...\" needs a comma after \"However.\"",

    "student_essay": "The German movie The Perfect Secret shows a theme that seems to work in almost any culture, how honesty, trust, and privacy affect relationships. The movies main idea is that a group of friends decides to share all the messages on their phones during a dinner. This situation creates a lot of tension, surprises, and funny moments. I think this story can be told in so many different countries because almost everyone has a phone and uses it to talk to friends, family, or romantic partners. Everyone also has secrets or things they keep private, so the story feels familiar no matter where you live.\n\nOne scene that really shows this is around 12 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, when the game starts and Bianca realizes how much personal information everyone can see. The friends all react with awkward laughter, shock, and a little panic. This scene shows how hard it is to balance honesty and privacy in relationships. It\u2019s something everyone can relate to because we all have moments when we don\u2019t want others to know everything about us, even our closest friends or partners. Another part that feels universal is when Pepe helps his student talk to a girl on social media. It shows that people often try to help each other but might do it in ways that reveal secrets or private things. These moments are both funny and real because they show how complicated relationships can be, even with good intentions.\n\nOverall, I think The Perfect Secret works in so many cultures because it talks about things that are true for everyone trust, curiosity, and dealing with secrets. The story uses a smartphone, which everyone knows, but it\u2019s really about how people interact, what they hide, and how they deal with each other. That\u2019s why the movie has been adapted into so many languages and still makes sense everywhere.",

To improve, you need to analyze why the character behaves as they do. Lastly, be careful with punctuation errors and possessive apostrophes.\n\nOverall, good work!",

This theme has universal applicability because it reflects the truth that people aren\u2019t completely honest in relationships. We might do it because we want to preserve the relationship and are worried that the truth might harm it.\n\nThis idea is particularly evident in how Pepe comes out in Video 3 starting at 3 minutes and 0 seconds. Pepe first calls out the casual homophobia that his friends do. This highlights one element of why Pepe did not come out to them. He felt that his friends might not accept him and that the Peretti Gang might disband, which is a group that represents a reprieve from the harassment from his workplace.\n\nOnly at the end, when other people shared their secrets, did he share his.

In fact, as can be seen in the suicide/death of one of the characters, drinking can also enhance negative and depressive feelings. However, although drinking was not the solution, and the film does not have a traditional Hollywood-like happy end, the main character, Martin, did undergo a transformation.\n\nIf the instructor suspects a student used an AI text generator (e.g., ChatGPT), the instructor will require student to complete a similar assignment using Honorlock, an online proctoring service.

What might be the final message of the movie as to one's attitude toward life and living?",
    "student_essay": "At first glance, Another Round is a fascinating film. You begin watching it, thinking, \"Is there anything positive I will learn from this film?\" But as the film goes on, it becomes clear that the central message of the film, being in a constant but controlled stupor will benefit your life, is not sustainable. This message is conveyed mainly through Martin's transformation, which begins as personal and emotional stagnation and culminates in a completely new outlook on life.  \n\nEarly in the film, Martin seemed depressed but also detached from his career and family. Around 5:00 minutes, he struggles to lead his class through a lesson on Winston Churchill and appears mentally dissociated from both the material and his students. In fact, his lack of focus becomes so apparent that students begin correcting him on the lesson's historical details, most notably Malthe. This emotional detachment continues at home, where, at approximately 5:55, the film cuts to a solemn Martin. Although he is physically present at the table, you can tell Martin has completely given up on life. He barely engages in conversation with his wife or kids and appears emotionally distant. This scene establishes that Martin's depression is affecting all areas of his life.\n\nA strong contrast happens later in the movie during the early stages of the alcohol experiment. Before entering his classroom, Martin tests his BAC (blood alcohol content) and reveals he is at a .047. Reflecting on what his group discussed, he is eager to see the effects. The camera then opens up to the classroom at around 1:03 in the second video, with Martin's demeanor toward his students changed. In the scene, Martin is much more relaxed, engaging with his students, and confident! He explains the lesson using an effective election metaphor, which gets many more students involved in the material.\n\nThe insight that allows Martin to grow is the realization that alcohol was never the true source of his confidence or his happiness. While the drinking lowered his anxiety and allowed him to reconnect to teaching, it created a nasty product in the end. The experiment revealed that all the qualities Martin thought he had lost were still inside him this whole time. By the end of the film, Martin realizes that real growth happens when you're actively engaged in life rather than escaping from it.",

    "student_essay": "The film \u201dAnother Round\u201d has many twists in the outcomes of alcohol endorsement.\nEven though keeping a BAC of 0.05% was supposed to make everyone feel more relaxed in the\nexperiment, it soon became something that grew out of control, leading to many damaged\nrelationships, and ruined reputations. In the film, Martin seems depressed and sad, trying to\nreconstruct his marriage (Another Round, video 4, 1:27). He realized the outcomes of\nparticipating in the experiment, and the effects of going overboard with drinking. In this scene,\nhe is telling his ex wife he misses her and is trying to apologize for his behavior. He seems to be\nholding a lot of regret in his actions, stating that he wishes he was back together with his wife.\nShortly after, Anika leaves the table saying she can no longer love him or be with him. On the\nother hand, Martin seems happy in the scene where he is canoeing with his family (Another\nRound, video 3, 1:02). They are trying to race down to the land in front of them, laughter is\nshared, and Martin seems truly happy around his family for the first time in the movie. After this\nclip the film displays \u201c0.0%\u201d showing that he did not have any drinks before this activity. I believe\nthis shows the true meaning of the film. While Martin's drinking was the reason this trip was\neven planned, he is truly happy to spend time with his family doing an activity they used to do\ntogether many years ago. However, after this he gets very drunk with his friends doing the\nexperiment, and this ends up very poorly. As a result, he has to explain his actions to his kids\nand wife. Anika brings up her concerns on how she has felt invisible to Martin for years. This\nshows that Martin gained the insight of being able to have fun with his family without alcohol. It\nalso shows him the damage drinking can do to his relationships. The final message of this film is\nthat temporary placeholders, such as drugs or drinking, will never solve problems but make\nthem much worse. This is why there was a temporary relief for Martin when he started drinking\nand teaching right after, but the overall result ended up with him losing his wife and being a bad\nexample for his children.",

    "student_essay": "I loved Around the World; I was very intrigued the entire movie about how these four\nmen believed that drinking alcohol every day was beneficial for them and made their lives\nbetter. At first it seemed that this was the case for Martin. Martin right away at the\nbeginning of the film already showed how unhappy and unmotivated he was with his life at\nhome and his professional career. The students in his class showed very little respect for\nMartin because martin didn't have any respect for himself. He even asked his wife, Anika, if\nhe was boring now compared to his younger self, at which point she didn't hesitate to say\nthat he isn't the same Martin she met all those years ago (video 1 at 6 minutes 56\nseconds.). At the birthday dinner for one of his four friends/collogues, they even expressed\nhow they thought he was boring for not drinking at dinner (video 1 at 12 minutes 35\nseconds), and told him that he lacks self-confidence and happiness in the classroom and\nthat is why his students misbehave (video 1 at 15 minutes 46 seconds). He confides in his\nfriends that he never sees many people and that he and his wife haven't been the same in\nso long before. So after the discussion about Finn Skarderud and his claim that you need to\nmaintain a 0.05% BAC to be more relaxed, poised, musical, and opened, Martin couldnt\nresist the temptation and immediately chugged a glass of wine at dinner to the point where\nthey stay out super late and have a great night (video 1 at 22 minutes 53 seconds). You\nstart to see that his confidence really does grow and he is more brave to be himself and\nactually get the students involved, you immediately can see that the students are far more\ninterested in class when Martin actually cares and is interested in what he is teaching\n(video 2 at 2 minutes 25 seconds). But not only did his confidence improve, it did at home\nas well, he took his family on their canoe and camping trip that they used to go on years\nago and even had an intimate moment with his wife (video 3 at 1 minute 20 seconds).\nHowever, the rush couldn't las forever, eventually everything came crashing down when all\nfour men couldn't go a day without depending on alcohol to get through the day and even\nlost their friend Tommy (video 4 at 10 minutes 55 seconds). Through everything though, I\nthink martin started to realize that alcohol is making his life worse, he saw what it did to his\nfriend tommy and really took a step back and looked in the mirror. I also think that he\nrealized he didn't need to drink to be passionate about what he does for a living. The\nstudents passing those exams really showed him that if he just put in some effort and\nattention, his students would pass, and it goes to show that just having confidence in\nyourself can make the world of a difference and how you see yourself, present yourself, but\nalso be there for others as well.",

Based on\nMartins character, the movie shows how real change does not come from drinking, it\ncomes from how a person chooses to face life and address their personal struggles.\nAt the beginning of the movie Martin is a teacher and his character is shown as depressed\nand unmotivated (Video 3, 10-15minutes). In this scene before the drinking experiments\neven begin Martin appears to be disconnected, tired and unhappy in his personal and\nprofessional life. The student in his classroom starts to question his teaching because he\nstruggles to keep them engaged and seems very unsure of himself.\nAs the movie goes on you can start to see a change in Martin attitude when teaching he\nseemed more confident and inspired (Video 3, 20-45 min). In this scene he is more energic\nand engages with his students more. He is happier and more present in the classroom than\nbefore. This scene shows his temporary sense of motivation.\nAnother scene is the graduation at the end of the movie when Martin joins in dancing and\ncelebrating (Video 3, 1 hour and 45 minutes). This scene shows that Martin has reached a\nplace where he feels more alive and open to life again despite the experiment causing\nserious consequences.\nThrough this experience, Martin realizes that alcohol was never the real solution. He gained\nthe understanding he needed to engage with life. The final message that the movie portrays\nis that growth comes from choosing to participate in life even when life becomes difficult\nor uncertain.",

    "feedback": "Hi Rajdai, \n\nYou identified a strong final message that growth comes from \"choosing to participate in life even when life becomes difficult.\" This aligns perfectly with the film's themes. \n\nHowever, you referenced \"Video3\" for scenes that happen at the very beginning of the movie. Please ensure you are referencing the correct video files in your timestamps. Additionally, to deepen your analysis, consider adding your interpretation of Martin's emotional change rather than just describing the scenes. For example, how exactly did he get more confident and inspired? Was it purely the alcohol, or was there something else? \n\nLastly, please double-check your writing before submission. I left comments on your submission. \n\nOverall, good job!",
