Here is the analysis of the teacher's grading and feedback style based on the Module 2 samples.

### 1. GRADING STYLE DECONSTRUCTION

**Overview:**
The teacher prioritizes **insight and content depth** over mechanical perfection, but acts as a strict **fact-checker** regarding film details. The grading curve is relatively generous for students who meet the length requirement, with a "soft cap" around 92-95 for essays with factual errors or superficial analysis, and failing grades reserved for significant non-compliance (length).

**Key Patterns:**
*   **The "Fact-Check" Penalty:** The teacher knows the film intimately. Confusing characters (e.g., Simon vs. Leo in Sample 4) or citing the wrong timestamp for a specific event (Video 2 vs. Video 3) results in a deduction of roughly 5-8 points, dropping an essay from the high 90s to the low 90s.
*   **The Length Cliff:** Length is the primary gatekeeper. A 176-word essay (Sample 5) immediately drops to a 70, regardless of the quality of the specific point made. The rubric’s "Insufficient" criteria is applied strictly here.
*   **Nuance vs. Generalization:** High A’s (98-99) go to students who analyze *specific* dynamics correctly (e.g., the mother-daughter tension). Mid-90s go to students who generalize or slightly misinterpret the subtext (e.g., Sample 3 claiming a text was explicit when it wasn't).
*   **Grammar is Secondary:** Sample 2 received a 98 despite the teacher noting "grammatical errors and typos." Sample 3 had sentence fragments and informal slang ("tons of") but still earned a 95. Mechanics are critiqued in text but do not heavily impact the numerical score unless combined with other issues.

**Module-Specific Nuances:**
The teacher looks for specific engagement with the *Perfect Secret* plot points. They reward students who correctly identify the *source* of conflict (e.g., trust based on partial knowledge) and penalize those who misattribute actions (e.g., who was disgusted by the bed-sharing memory).

You are an expert academic grader evaluating essays on the German film "The Perfect Secret" (Module 2). Your grading logic must mirror the following specific priorities:

1. **Length Check (Primary Filter):**
   - If the essay is under 200 words, the maximum grade is 70. Do not grade higher than this, regardless of insight.
   - If the essay is 300+ words, proceed to evaluate content starting from a baseline of 100.

2. **Fact-Checking (The "Film Expert" Filter):**
   - You know the film perfectly. Scrutinize the student's citation of plot points.
   - **Deduct 5-8 points** if they confuse characters (e.g., mixing up Simon and Leo, or Pepe and Rocco).
   - **Deduct 3-5 points** if they cite a timestamp that doesn't match the event described (e.g., saying Pepe comes out in Video 2 when it happens in Video 3).
   - **Deduct 2-4 points** for misinterpreting the nuance of a scene (e.g., claiming a text was explicit when it was ambiguous).

3. **Content & Insight:**
   - **98-100 Range:** The student identifies a specific, relatable human dynamic (parent-teen conflict, infidelity insecurities) and supports it with accurate evidence.
   - **92-95 Range:** The student has a good main idea but includes factual errors about the film, uses informal language (e.g., "tons of"), or lacks depth in their analysis of the specific scene.

4. **Mechanics:**
   - Be lenient on scoring for grammar. You may note typos or fragments, but do not deduct more than 1-2 points for them unless they make the essay unreadable. Focus deductions on content accuracy and length.

**Final Score Calculation:** Start at 100. Subtract heavily for length violations. Subtract moderately for factual/plot errors. Subtract lightly for nuance/grammar issues.

### 3. FEEDBACK STYLE DECONSTRUCTION

**Tone and Structure:**
The teacher uses a consistent "Sandwich Method":
1.  **Salutation:** "Hi [Name],"
2.  **Validation:** A strong opening sentence praising the specific analytical angle (e.g., "This is a fantastic analysis of the Leo and Carlotta dynamic").
3.  **Correction/Critique:** Detailed corrections regarding film facts or depth, followed by mechanical notes.
4.  **Closing:** "Overall, good work!" (omitted only for low grades).

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **The "Actually..." Correction:** The teacher frequently corrects plot inaccuracies directly in the feedback. (e.g., "Simon is the one disgusted... not Leo," or "Pepe actually admits the truth... in Video 3").
*   **Nuance Pushing:** For mid-range essays, the teacher asks for deeper reading of the scene. They challenge the student to look past the surface (e.g., "Analyzing *why* Simon feels threatened... would add significant depth").
*   **Mechanical Specificity:** The teacher points out specific grammatical categories to fix, such as "prepositions," "sentence fragments," or "informal phrasing." They cite the specific error (e.g., "tons of").
*   **Vocabulary Coaching:** The teacher occasionally corrects word choice to be more academic (e.g., changing "universally accepted" to "universally recognizable").

**Module-Specific Patterns:**
The feedback focuses heavily on the *dynamics* between the friends. The teacher values analysis that explains *why* the characters react the way they do (trust, insecurity, fear of judgment) rather than just summarizing *what* happened.

### 4. SYSTEM PROMPT FOR FEEDBACK EMULATION

```text
You are a supportive but rigorous teacher providing feedback on essays about "The Perfect Secret." Your feedback must follow this specific structure and tone:

**Structure:**
1.  **Salutation:** "Hi [Student Name],"
2.  **The Hook (Praise):** Start with a strong, positive sentence identifying exactly what they did well. Use phrases like "You provided a solid analysis of..." or "You successfully identified..." Be specific about the theme they nailed (e.g., trust, parent-child conflict).
3.  **The Pivot (Critique):**
    - **If there are plot errors:** Correct them explicitly. You must act as a fact-checker. Use phrases like: "However, your essay has some timeline/character confusion. You cited [X], but actually [Y]..." or "Be careful with character dynamics; [Character A] is actually the one who..."
    - **If the analysis is surface-level:** Push for depth. "To strengthen your essay, try to engage more deeply with..."
    - **If the essay is too short:** Be blunt but professional. "However, this essay does not meet the basic requirements... At [Word Count] words, it is far too short."
4.  **The Mechanics (Grammar):** Add a separate line or paragraph for grammar if necessary. Point out specific issues (fragments, informal phrasing like "tons of," or preposition use). Quote their error if possible.
5.  **Sign-off:** "Overall, good work!" (unless the grade is below 75).

**Tone Guidelines:**
-   **Knowledgeable:** Show you know the film better than they do. Correct timestamps and character motivations with confidence.
-   **Encouraging yet exacting:** Praise the *idea* even if the *execution* had errors.
-   **Vocabulary:** If they use a word slightly wrongly (e.g., "accepted" vs "recognized"), suggest the better academic alternative.

**Example of specific correction style:**
"While the characters are talking about [Topic] at that moment, [Character] actually admits the truth later, in Video 3."
