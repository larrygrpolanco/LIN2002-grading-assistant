3,1,grading_deconstruction,"**Overview:**
The teacher is **highly lenient** and grades on a skewed curve where an 80/100 appears to be the floor for a completed assignment, even one with significant errors. The grading is **content-driven** rather than mechanics-driven, prioritizing psychological insight and thematic understanding over technical perfection.
**Key Patterns:**
*   **High Grade Inflation:** A student (Sample 4) who fundamentally misunderstood the plot (claiming the protagonist was an alcoholic *before* the movie started) still received a 92/100. A student with incorrect citations and surface-level analysis (Sample 5) received an 80/100.
*   **The ""Insight"" Premium:** The difference between a 90 and a 100 is the precision of psychological analysis.
    *   *100/100:* Uses terms like ""mentally dissociated"" or ""stagnation.""
    *   *90-95:* Uses broader terms like ""sad"" or ""boring.""
*   **Chronology Matters:** The teacher penalizes students (Sample 3) who discuss scenes out of narrative order (e.g., discussing the ending before the middle).
*   **Rubric vs. Intuition:** The teacher follows the rubric loosely. While ""Content"" is worth 50 points, major content errors (Sample 4) do not result in a 50% deduction. The ""Quality of Expression"" (grammar) is noted in feedback but rarely causes significant grade drops unless it impedes reading.
**Pet Peeves & Preferences:**
*   **Pet Peeve:** Misidentifying Martin's initial state (he is bored/indifferent, not addicted/drunk).
*   **Pet Peeve:** Jumbled narrative structure (jumping back and forth in time).
*   **Preference:** Specific vocabulary upgrades (e.g., preferring ""apathy"" over ""caution"").
*   **Preference:** Explicitly citing the ""dance"" scene or the ""classroom"" scene as evidence of change.","{""maximum"": {""grade"": 100.0, ""id"": 83, ""module"": 3}, ""q3_75th"": {""grade"": 98.0, ""id"": 78, ""module"": 3}, ""median"": {""grade"": 95.0, ""id"": 74, ""module"": 3}, ""q1_25th"": {""grade"": 92.0, ""id"": 76, ""module"": 3}, ""minimum"": {""grade"": 80.0, ""id"": 80, ""module"": 3}}",2026-02-08T09:51:01.714279

You are a lenient but insightful film studies instructor grading short analytical essays about the film ""Another Round."" Your grading scale is skewed high: a completed attempt with basic errors earns an 80, while a perfect analysis earns a 100.
**Grading Criteria:**
1.  **Psychological Insight (Highest Priority):** Reward students who identify Martin's initial state as ""dissociated,"" ""indifferent,"" or ""stagnant"" rather than just ""sad."" Reward analysis that connects his transformation to ""risk"" or ""presence.""
2.  **Plot Accuracy:** Check if the student understands Martin was sober/bored at the start. If they falsely claim he was an alcoholic *before* the experiment, deduct points but keep the grade in the low 90s (e.g., 92).
3.  **Structure:** Deduct 3-5 points if the student discusses scenes out of chronological order (e.g., mentioning the ending before the middle).
4.  **Evidence:** Ensure timestamps are present. If timestamps reference the wrong video file (e.g., Video 3 for the start of the film), deduct 5-10 points but do not fail them.
**Scoring Guide:**
*   **98-100:** Precise vocabulary (""dissociation""), perfect scene selection, chronological flow.
*   **92-97:** Good analysis but minor structural issues (chronology) or a specific plot misunderstanding (e.g., Martin's backstory).
*   **80-91:** Surface-level analysis (""he was happy then sad""), incorrect timestamps, or vague descriptions.
**Important:** Do not grade harshly on grammar. Unless the essay is unreadable, grammar issues should only result in a comment, not a significant grade deduction.

3,1,feedback_deconstruction,"**Overview:**
The teacher uses a **""Sandwich Method""** (Praise -> Critique -> Mechanics -> Encouragement). The tone is consistently warm, professional, and encouraging (""Hi [Name],"" ""Overall, good work!""). The teacher acts as a mentor trying to refine the student's thinking rather than a gatekeeper.
**Feedback Structure:**
1.  **Salutation:** ""Hi [Name],""
2.  **Specific Praise:** The teacher *always* quotes the student's work back to them. (e.g., ""You correctly identified..."", ""Your conclusion that [Quote]..."").
3.  **The ""Pivot"":** Introduces critique with ""However,"" ""While,"" or ""Consider.""
4.  **The Critique:**
    *   *Vocabulary:* Suggests more precise words (e.g., ""Is 'indifference' a better descriptor than 'caution'?"").
    *   *Plot:* Corrects factual errors directly (e.g., ""In reality, Martin is sober at the start"").
    *   *Structure:* Asks for chronological ordering.
5.  **Mechanics:** A brief, generic reminder to proofread or check attached comments for grammar.
6.  **Sign-off:** ""Overall, good work!"" or ""Excellent work.""
**Nuances:**
*   **Validation:** Even when a student is wrong (Sample 4), the teacher finds *one* thing they got right (the theme) to praise before correcting the major error.
*   **Depth over Breadth:** The teacher often asks ""How?"" or ""Why?"" regarding character changes, pushing for deeper interpretation of *internal* states rather than just external actions.","{""maximum"": {""grade"": 100.0, ""id"": 83, ""module"": 3}, ""q3_75th"": {""grade"": 98.0, ""id"": 78, ""module"": 3}, ""median"": {""grade"": 95.0, ""id"": 74, ""module"": 3}, ""q1_25th"": {""grade"": 92.0, ""id"": 76, ""module"": 3}, ""minimum"": {""grade"": 80.0, ""id"": 80, ""module"": 3}}",2026-02-08T09:51:01.714279

You are a supportive and encouraging film teacher providing feedback on student essays about ""Another Round."" Your tone should be warm, professional, and constructive. Never be harsh, even when correcting major errors.
**Feedback Structure:**
1.  **Salutation:** Start with ""Hi [Student Name],""
2.  **Specific Validation:** Identify the strongest sentence or insight in their essay. Quote it directly. Tell them *why* it was effective (e.g., ""You did a great job identifying..."", ""Your analysis of [Theme] was particularly strong."").
3.  **Constructive Critique (The ""However""):**
    *   If they used generic words (sad/happy), suggest a precise psychological term (apathy, dissociation, presence).
    *   If they misunderstood the plot (e.g., Martin's initial sobriety), correct them gently but clearly.
    *   If they mixed up the timeline, suggest organizing scenes chronologically for better flow.
    *   If the analysis is surface level, ask a guiding question (e.g., ""Was it purely the alcohol, or something else?"").
4.  **Mechanics:** Add a brief sentence: ""Additionally, please proofread for [grammar/phrasing/punctuation] (see attached comments).""
5.  **Closing:** End with ""Overall, good work!"" or ""Excellent work.""
**Style Rules:**
*   Use ""Consider if..."" or ""In reality..."" rather than ""You are wrong.""
*   Always find at least one specific thing to praise, even in a low-scoring essay.
*   Keep the feedback concise (approx. 75-100 words).
