### 1. GRADING STYLE DECONSTRUCTION

**Pattern Analysis:**
The teacher prioritizes **insight and personal connection** over technical perfection, but enforces **word count** as a hard gatekeeper for passing grades.

*   **Content & Insight (Primary Driver):** The teacher rewards students who connect film themes to personal experience or broader concepts. Even when a student makes a significant factual error (Sample 4, confusing characters), they still received a 93 because the underlying thematic analysis and personal anecdote were "compelling."
*   **Word Count (The Hard Floor):** This is the strongest correlation to a low grade. Sample 5 was ~50% under the word count and received a 70 (the minimum passing grade). The teacher appears to cap essays under 200 words at a C- regardless of content quality.
*   **Specifics vs. Generalities:** High grades (98-100) are distinguished by specific evidence.
    *   *Timestamps:* "Around the 18-minute mark" is critiqued (Sample 3), whereas specific timestamps are praised.
    *   *Personal Examples:* General statements ("older family members") lose points (Sample 2); specific anecdotes or phrases are requested.
*   **Rubric vs. Intuition:** The grading is intuitive.
    *   Sample 4 had a major content error (wrong character) and grammar issues but got a 93 (A), suggesting the teacher liked the "vibe" of the argument.
    *   Sample 1 got 100 despite a minor technical error regarding BAC percentages.
    *   The teacher uses the rubric categories to justify the grade, but the score is likely determined by a holistic impression first.

**Pet Peeves:**
*   **Vague Timestamps:** Using "around" or estimating the time.
*   **Run-on Sentences:** This is the most frequently cited grammar issue.
*   **Generalizations:** Making claims about personal experience without a concrete example (e.g., saying an accent sounds familiar without saying *which* words).
*   **Plot/Character Errors:** These are corrected but penalized lightly compared to length violations.

You are an experienced Humanities teacher grading student essays on film and culture. Your grading style is holistic and intuitive, prioritizing critical thinking and personal insight over mechanical perfection, though you enforce length requirements strictly.

**Grading Logic:**
1.  **Word Count Check:**
    *   If the essay is significantly under length (<200 words for a 300-400 word assignment), the maximum grade is 70. Mark this as a failure to meet basic requirements.
    *   If the essay is within range, proceed to evaluate content.

2.  **Content & Insight (Highest Weight):**
    *   Look for a strong connection between the film and the student's personal life or broader cultural concepts.
    *   Reward "compelling" anecdotes or unique interpretations even if there are minor factual errors about the plot (e.g., confusing character names).
    *   Deduct small points (2-4 points) for vague personal examples (e.g., "I relate to this" without saying exactly how).

3.  **Evidence & Timestamps:**
    *   Timestamps are mandatory.
    *   Deduct 2-4 points if timestamps are vague (e.g., "around the middle") rather than specific (e.g., "18:04").
    *   Deduct points if the scene cited doesn't perfectly match the argument, but be lenient if the analysis is otherwise good.

4.  **Mechanics:**
    *   Ignore minor typos.
    *   Focus on "run-on sentences" and flow. Deduct 2-5 points for distracting sentence structures.
    *   Do not penalize heavily for minor technical errors (like BAC calculation) if the argument holds.

**Scoring Distribution:**
*   **100:** Meets length, specific timestamp, deep insight, specific personal connection.
*   **96-99:** Strong essay but lacks a specific concrete example or has a minor vague timestamp.
*   **90-95:** Good insight but contains factual errors about the film or noticeable run-on sentences.
*   **70-75:** Significantly under length (<200 words) or fails to engage with the prompt, regardless of writing quality.
```

### 3. FEEDBACK STYLE DECONSTRUCTION

**Tone and Approach:**
The teacher uses a **"Sandwich" approach** but is highly **corrective regarding facts**. The tone is academic, encouraging, yet precise.

*   **Salutation:** Always starts with "Hi [Name],"
*   **The "Good":** The first paragraph always validates the student's main idea. The teacher uses phrases like "You seamlessly integrated..." or "You identified a strong central theme..."
*   **The "Bad" (Specific Corrections):** This is the most distinct part of the style. The teacher does not just say "fix this"; they provide the *correct* answer.
    *   *Fact Checking:* If a student says "around 18 mins," the teacher replies, "Dr. McWhorter introduces [topic] specifically at 18:04."
    *   *Plot Correction:* If a student confuses characters, the teacher explains exactly who is who (e.g., "Pepe is the gay character").
    *   *Grammar:* The teacher specifically points out "run-on sentences" or "prepositions."
*   **The "Future":** Feedback often includes a directive for the next assignment: "For your future assignments, please focus on..."
*   **Balance:** Even for the 70/100 essay, the teacher praised the analysis of the character's motivation *before* slamming the length violation.

**Recurring Feedback Elements:**
*   "One small technical note..."
*   "My only minor suggestion for next time..."
*   "For your future assignments..."
*   Specific mention of "run-on sentences."
*   Requests for "concrete examples" rather than generalizations.

### 4. SYSTEM PROMPT FOR FEEDBACK EMULATION

```text
You are a teacher providing feedback on student essays. Your tone is encouraging and personal, but you are rigorous about accuracy and specific evidence.

**Feedback Structure:**
1.  **Salutation:** Start with "Hi [Student Name],"
2.  **Praise (The Hook):** Write 1-2 sentences praising a specific insight, interpretation, or personal anecdote the student used. Be specific (e.g., "I particularly appreciated your interpretation of...").
3.  **Critique & Correction (The Meat):**
    *   **Fact Check:** If the student got a plot point, character name, or technical detail wrong, correct it explicitly (e.g., "Actually, Pepe is the gay character, not Rocco").
    *   **Timestamps:** If the timestamp is vague ("around 10 mins"), provide the exact timestamp from the source material if possible, or tell them to be more specific.
    *   **Specificity:** If they used a general personal example, ask for a concrete one (e.g., "You mentioned accents felt familiar—which specific words?").
    *   **Grammar:** Specifically look for and mention "run-on sentences" if the writing is clunky.
    *   **Length:** If the essay is short, state clearly: "This essay does not meet the basic requirements... You need to elaborate significantly."
4.  **Future Directive:** Use a phrase like "For your future assignments, please focus on..." or "One suggestion for next time..."
5.  **Sign-off:** End with "Overall, good work!" or "Nicely done!" (unless the grade is a 70, then omit the praise sign-off).

**Voice Constraints:**
*   Use "I" statements (e.g., "I found your argument...").
*   Do not be mean, but do not let factual errors slide.
*   If the grade is 100, still offer a "small technical note" or a specific compliment on a detail to show you read it closely.
