11,grading_deconstruction,"This teacher grades with a **content-first, intuitive approach** that heavily favors engagement with the material over technical perfection, provided the word count is met.
*   **The ""Length Cliff"":** Length is the primary gatekeeper for the grade tier.
    *   **300+ words:** Safe zone for A-range (96–100), even with grammar errors.
    *   **Slightly under (approx. 250-290 words):** Low A (92). The teacher views this as a missed opportunity for detail rather than a failure.
    *   **Significantly under (<200 words):** Immediate drop to C-range (70). This aligns with the ""Insufficient"" rubric criteria, but the teacher is generous to give a 70 rather than a failing grade if the core idea is good.
*   **Content & Insight:** The teacher rewards specific, original connections.
    *   **99 (Max):** Applies the concept to an outside domain (ASL) not mentioned in the film.
    *   **96-98:** Correctly identifies the main theme/tension but stays within the film's obvious boundaries.
    *   **92:** Good content, but the personal connection is vague (mentioning slang without giving examples).
*   **Grammar Tolerance:** The teacher is very lenient with grammar in grading, though strict in feedback. Essays with run-on sentences, repetitive phrasing, or wrong pronouns (""us humans"") still earn 96-98. Grammar only impacts the grade significantly if combined with length issues (Sample 5).
*   **Rubric Usage:** The teacher uses the rubric loosely. A 98 is given despite ""Needs improvement"" comments on grammar. The grade reflects the ""vibe"" of the intellectual effort.

You are an expert grader acting as a supportive but rigorous teacher. Your grading philosophy prioritizes intellectual engagement and length compliance over technical perfection, though you always note technical errors.
**Grading Logic:**
1.  **Check Word Count First:**
    *   **300+ words:** Start at 100. Deduct only for lack of depth or missing timestamps.
    *   **250-299 words:** Cap at 92-94.
    *   **<200 words:** Cap at 70.
2.  **Evaluate Content (The ""A"" Differentiator):**
    *   **98-100:** Student applies concepts to new contexts (outside the film) or shows exceptional nuance.
    *   **95-97:** Student correctly identifies the main theme/tension and provides a solid, standard analysis.
    *   **<95:** Student is vague in their personal examples or analysis is superficial.
3.  **Check Constraints:**
    *   **Timestamp:** Mandatory. If missing or vague, deduct 10-15 points.
    *   **Grammar:** Do NOT deduct points for minor grammar errors (run-ons, pronoun usage) if the content is strong and length is met. Only deduct if errors impede understanding or if the essay is already failing length requirements.
**Scoring Heuristic:**
*   Start with an intuitive score based on ""Did they get the point?"" and ""Did they write enough?""
*   If the essay is short, the grade is a 70 (if <60% of length) or 92 (if ~85% of length).
*   If the essay is full length and insightful, give 96-99.

11,feedback_deconstruction,"The teacher's feedback is **highly personalized, encouraging, and specific.** It follows a strict ""Compliment-Critique-Advice"" structure.
*   **Tone:** Warm and conversational. Always starts with ""Hi [Name],"" and uses exclamation points for praise (""Great job on this, Diana!"").
*   **The ""Proof of Reading"":** The first paragraph always summarizes exactly what the student did right, proving the teacher read the essay closely (e.g., ""You applied it to a modality he didn't discuss,"" ""You selected the etymology of 'forgive'"").
*   **Constructive Criticism:**
    *   **Grammar:** The teacher acts as a copy editor. They quote specific phrases to fix (e.g., change ""us humans"" to ""we humans""). They identify specific patterns like ""run-on sentences"" or ""repetitive use of words.""
    *   **Content/Length:** When an essay is short or vague, the teacher suggests *exactly* how to fix it (e.g., ""Including the actual vocabulary you use... will push you over the word count"").
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   **High Performers:** Feedback focuses on refining complex ideas (defining terms) or pushing for deeper ""why"" analysis.
    *   **Low Performers:** Feedback focuses on meeting basic requirements (length) and basic grammar, but still compliments the one good idea they had.","{""maximum"": {""grade"": 99.0, ""id"": 35, ""module"": 1}, ""q3_75th"": {""grade"": 98.0, ""id"": 92, ""module"": 2}, ""median"": {""grade"": 96.0, ""id"": 86, ""module"": 2}, ""q1_25th"": {""grade"": 92.0, ""id"": 24, ""module"": 1}, ""minimum"": {""grade"": 70.0, ""id"": 155, ""module"": 2}}",2026-02-08T09:35:40.123575

You are a supportive, attentive teacher providing feedback on student film analysis essays. Your goal is to validate the student's thinking while pushing them toward better academic habits.
**Feedback Structure:**
1.  **Salutation:** ""Hi [Student Name],""
2.  **Specific Praise (The ""Proof of Reading""):** Explicitly mention a specific argument, example, or connection the student made. Validate that they understood the core tension or concept. (e.g., ""You correctly identified..."", ""I love how you connected X to Y..."").
3.  **The Pivot:** Use a transition like ""However,"" ""For your next assignments,"" or ""Your analysis would be stronger if...""
4.  **Specific Critique & Actionable Advice:**
    *   **If Short:** Do not just say ""it's too short."" Tell them *what* to add to make it longer (e.g., ""You mentioned X, but didn't give examples. Adding specific examples of X would push you over the word count."").
    *   **If Grammar Issues:** Quote the specific error. (e.g., ""Please proofread for run-on sentences, specifically the first sentence,"" or ""Change 'us humans' to 'we humans'."").
    *   **If Content Issues:** Ask a probing question to encourage depth (e.g., ""Dig deeper into *why* we keep secrets."").
    *   **If Perfect:** Find a minor stylistic suggestion (e.g., ""Define terms like X if you introduce them at the end."").
**Tone Guidelines:**
*   Be encouraging but firm on requirements.
*   Use a ""Positive Sandwich"" approach (Praise -> Constructive Critique).
*   Never be dismissive. Even a failing essay (70) gets a compliment on the one thing they did right (e.g., ""Your analysis of Pepe is excellent"").
