1,"The first episode of the documentary series, Language Families of the World, is an introduction to the process of derivation of languages and how languages have changed over the span of humanity. Dr. McWhorter expands on the many aspects of language, including the inherent need for a language to change and how that change is inevitable (6:15). When a group of people speaking the same language get separated for a long time, the way each group speaks that language changes over time. Similarly, language changes over generations as each generation pronounces sounds differently. Dr. McWhorter expands on this by explaining how the different syllables of the word “sock” can transform into different sounds. This is an example of sound change, one the many processes by which words change over time.

The other way a language can transform is by the addition of new material such as suffixes and prefixes. He gives an example of the word ‘slowly’ where the suffix ‘-ly’ was derived from the word ‘like’. Meaning changes can also transform one language into another as a word’s original meaning changes over time to represent different things. An interesting example is how the words ‘merry’, ‘bra’ and ‘pretzel’ all trace back to one word in Ukrainian which meant ‘short’. This happened through not just meaning changes in the original Ukrainian word but also in sound changes over time. This is something that I observed in this segment of the video: certain words can go through multiple processes of transformation at the same time.

The reason why this segment of the video stood out to me is because how I speak my native tongue Bengali in comparison to my parents’ generation and the ones before them. I had noticed that my peers and I use newer words and certain words in a completely different way than them. I used to believe that our way of speaking was inherently harming the language by not conserving it properly but now I understand that change of language is inevitable. While conservation of language is necessary, there is no right way of using it as it will change over time.",98,"Hi [student], this is a thoughtful essay. You did a good job summarizing the three key mechanisms of language change, and your reflection on your use of newly developed terms isn't harming the Bengali language, but participating in its evolution is a sophisticated insight! 

For future assignments, I'd love to see more specific examples from your personal experience. For example, you mentioned that you use words differently from your parents -  which words specifically? 

Also, please proofread for typos; you wrote 'one the many' instead of 'one of the many.' "
1,"After watching this film, I found many things interesting, and learned about many topics that
were completely new to me. In particular, (“Why are there so many Languages?” S1. E1. 13 minutes 45
seconds), Dr McWorther states how the words “merry”, “bra” and “pretzel” all trace back to a distant
English ancestor. He begins to draw the connection from a Ukrainian word that no longer exists. This
word stood for “short”, however English did not exist at the time. This word then went on to become
“merry” in the English language due to the connection of something being short existing as a positive
outcome. The Ukrainian word then changes even more over time, leading to the creation of the word
“bra”. After this, the sounds change even further leading to the creation of the word “pretzel”, which
connects to crossed arms, and brachial. I found this very interesting due to personally assuming these
languages to be nothing alike. The concept of these commonly used English words all being developed
from the same origin of a Ukrainian word that no longer exists is very surprising. Without this video, I
would have never thought that “pretzel” and “merry” come from an origin that is anything but close to
each other. I am further intrigued by this connection due to personally being born in Ukraine, and learning
Russian (part of the East Slavic family, like Ukranian) and English simultaneously. Growing up, I was
able to slowly learn and make connections across both languages. As I am now, more developed, I can
really reflect on these connections and see how important the change of sound is in a language. For
example “mathematics” in English has a similar sound to the pronunciation of “matematika” in Russian.
We can also see the opposite using another example, such as “tree” in English, and the Russian
pronunciation being “derevo”. The sounds are completely different, even when they mean the same word,
which is not like the case for the word “mathematics”. Furthermore, being corrected by my family for my
improper pronunciation of some Russian words shows a connection between how each individual can
change the sounds of a language, leading to overall change in hundreds of years. Conclusively, I found
this video very interesting, especially the point about how three english words today came from an origin
that is my birthplace.",97,"Hi Diana, great job providing a wonderful personal reflection. Your connection to the material (being born in Ukraine and learning Russian and English simultaneously) offered such a unique insight. 

For the future assignments, please proofread your writing, specifically in terms of spelling (e.g., McWorther --> McWhorter), capitalization (e.g., englihs --> English). Also, try to use 'In conclusion' rather than 'Conclusively' to end your essay, as 'conclusively' usually means 'decisively' rather than 'finally.' "
1,"The topic that I found extremely interesting that Dr.McWorther brought up at the 3 minute mark of the film Language Families of the World video, is the fact that ""the original Homo sapiens spoke, a species wide trait that originated  presumably in East Africa."" From that one language developed 7000-8000 different languages. I find this very intriguing because as man of faith, I spend time reading the bible and its wonderful stories. In Genesis, the first book in the Bible in chapter 11 talks about the story of ""Babel"". In this parable it describes how the people of this region attempted to build a city and a tower reaching the heavens to make a name for themselves, united by a single language. Their ambition and pride led to God confusing their speech, as well as scattering them across the earth which forced them to stop building. Being that God scattered the people across the earth and confused their speech this led to many of the different languages that we have in the world. I believe this parable expresses the origin of linguistic and cultural  diversity as described in the film.",80,"
Hi [student], you made a great conceptual connection here. Comparing the linguistic theory to the Bible is an insightful parallel. 

However, for your next assignments, pay attention to these: 

Length: This essay is too short (190 words). You can explore the difference between the theory and the Bible. Discussing how those two differ would easily get you over the word count.
Timestamp: Please be specific with your timestamps. You mentioned the ""3 minute mark,"" but the quote you used actually starts at 2:57. 
Spelling & Grammar: You misspelled the professor's name (it is McWhorter, not ""McWorther"") and missed an article (""as a man of faith""). "
1,"After viewing the film, I found a lot of what Dr McWhorter had to say to be very interesting and I
learned a lot of new facts. Towards the end of that film (video 1, 24 min 47 seconds), he stated that “the
click languages are not just click sounds, and those sounds that we hear are just as important as our own
consonants and vowels are”(McWhorter). He also made a point after giving an example of what a word
would be like in those interesting languages, that it looks like, for us, someone just fell asleep at the
keyboard and woke up to an accidental typo. He states that in North America, a lot of their sentences can
be contained in just a single word. For us English speakers, that doesn’t add up because there is no
separation, and it all looks like a big mess. But for them, there are pieces to that blob that add up and
create meaning for them. I find this so intriguing due to the fact that I am so used to reading words that
have vowels and consonants, which build into a word, and I can’t seem to figure out how all those
consonants add up to create meaning. Who built that lnagauge and started that? How did someone just
make that up? It is so cool how many languages we have in this world today, yet they are different, but
they all relate to each other. Each language connects, and it all started from just one singular language. A
connection I can draw for a personal experience is when I was learning how to play sports when I was
younger. There were so many terms and slang that were used, and I was so confused because my mind
wasn’t trained to translate them. After a lot of practice and repetition, I got used to that norm and realized
that it all made sense and everything connected ot one another. When I was in the sports environment and
playing and practicing, I would use that certain vocab on a daily basis because it became a norm, but as
soon as I would leave or go home, I would switch to the words I would use normally. I think that the
environment you are in has a lot to do with how comfortable you are with learning new things and getting
used to having things be out of the ordinary. The more you practice, the better you will get at something
and the more comfortable you will be.",97,"
Hi Marley, great job on this reflection. You successfully captured the video's main points, including Dr. McWhorter's keyboard analogy. Your personal connection regarding sports jargon was excellent and demonstrated a good grasp of the material. 

For future assignments, please double-check for typos ('lnagauge,' 'ot') and aim to use slightly more academic descriptors instead of words like 'big mess' or 'blob'. "
1,"In Language Families of the World, at the 19:30 mark, Dr. McWhorter discusses the
Language Family Tree, providing an overview of the world’s language families in the form of
a global tour - one continent at a time. I found this part of the film intriguing as it gives a
visual demonstration of the clustering of specific related languages. It was interesting to
see on a map how proximity plays into a language’s development and eventual splitting off
into another related language. It also aids me in understanding the vastness of the world’s
languages: as Dr. McWhortner presents at the outset of the film, there are 7,000 languages
in the world (or 6,000, as is Dr. McWhortner’s preferred estimate) but that is such large
number it is difficult to comprehend the reality of there being so many languages spoken in
the world. However, seeing it presented as a break-down into language families helps me
to grasp the information in a way that is concrete rather than conceptual. For instance,
living here in the United States, it is surprising to know that there are 10 language families
here. The map presented in the film shows there is a language family that stretches across
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and into Northern Florida. This is especially interesting to
me as I visited Mobile, Alabama in 2023 and learned that it had a very similar history as
New Orleans. Seeing that the two cities share the same language family helps me connect
this information to the fascinating history of the region and I am better able to imagine and
comprehend the people speaking the languages, not just an abstract number of
languages.
Another amazing example presented in the film is that New Guinea, a small island in
Oceania, has 25 language families. How many languages are in each language family, and
how many total languages are there in that land? How and why did New Guinea become so
linguistically diverse? How many speakers are there of each language? Dr. McWhorter
does not discuss the answers to these specific questions in the film, but provides enough
information to illicit curiosity and engagement, which I enjoyed and found interesting",96,"
Hi Alexix, you did a great job connecting the map visualization to your personal travels in the US. 

For your next assignments, be careful with typos and word choices. You consistently misspelled the professor's name as ""McWhortner,"" and you used the word ""illicit"" (which means illegal or forbidden) when you likely meant ""elicit."" 

Finally, regarding your point about Alabama and Louisiana: the map Dr. McWhorter shows refers to indigenous language families, whereas the ""shared history"" of Mobile and New Orleans usually refers to French/Spanish colonialism."

Your example of English and Spanish blending together was a perfect illustration of sound change. 

I want to clarify one point from the video: Dr. McWhorter compares sound change to a 'drunk person' only as an analogy to show how words get slurred, not to suggest that accents are actually 'bourbon-influenced.' 

Also, for future assignments, you do not need to include a full reference list (e.g., 'Language Families..narrated by...'). Since the word count is tight, I would prefer to read more of your own analysis rather than using 28 words for a citation. Finally, watch out for redundancy; in one sentence, you used the phrase 'for instance' twice. 

Overall, great job connecting the concepts to your life."
1,"At 18:04, Dr. McWorther begins to talk about the English dialect of ""Black Country English,"" that was spoken in the west midlands of America and is special specifically because it is an example of a dialect that wasn't written down and changed a lot as a result. It's name originates from what McWorther says is ""coal dust"" which has lead me to assume - since McWorther didn't emphasize this point too greatly -  that this was a dialect spoken specifically by coal miners back when that was a common industry in America. 

Black Country English developed in such a way that it began to sound like another language entirely, with the video going so far as to compare it to Norwegian. Many of the words that are in the past tense or that are conjugations got shortened into word that seem either heavily accented or like totally different words. One example of this is the word ""gave"" morphing into ""Gid"". 

While this specific dialect is interesting, I'm mostly interested in what it represents, which is how language can be changed by things like culture and other outside factors. In this case, English was altered by a lack of literacy/lack of people writing things down which led to a whole new dialect. While there are instances of languages changing just as a result of time and human error or imperfection (which is discussed earlier in the video when McWorther talks about sound changes eventually changing how words are said) I know from my own knowledge and observation of language that there are many things that can effect how we talk to one another and I find that very interesting. One personal example is how some of the slang that I've seen develop over the course of my life has become a legitimate, or at the very least more commonly used, part of the english language. Being able to study this pattern in other cultures is something I find very interesting. ",92,"Hi Alexandra, good job identifying a specific section of the film and engaging with it personally. Your comparison between the evolution of the ""Black Country"" dialect and the acceptance of modern slang was a thoughtful insight.

However, there is a factual clarification: ""Black Country English"" is spoken in the UK, not the US. Also, for your next assignment, I'd love to see more specific examples to back up your opinions. For example, which slang words have you seen evolve? Finally, please proofread your writing for errors, such as capitalizing 'English' and using the possessive 'its' rather than 'it's.' "
1,"Dr. McWorther discussed very interesting topics in Language Families of the World. He
explained that number of languages in the world is about 7000 (Video 1min 22 seconds)
and how all of them are likely developed from a single language (Video 1 min 30 seconds).
With all the great information that he provided, the one thing that I found very interesting is
the fact that language can change and evolve over time. He went into great details about
this when he discussed Dialect of Black country English (Video 18 minutes 5 sec) some
examples he gave is “I give” they say it as ‘I gid”, we say, “ I did” and “ I don’t” they say “ I
dey”.
One of the main reasons that I found this topic about language evolving interesting is
because I grew up in a country called Guyana which was once ruled by the British and what
I didn’t realize was that most of the words that we spoke in “Guyanese Creole” are words
that were derived from the English dictionary. Over time the words and pronunciation had
changed so much that it could hardly be recognized what the original word was. I
remembered when I immigrated to the United States at the age of 13 and I was in Middle
school there were certain words that I pronounced differently words such as mattress and
Colgate. Even the word color I was taught that it was spelled as colour. In the video (7 mins
40 seconds) Dr. Mc Worther went into details about the changing of sounds using the word
sock. He discussed how sock has three sounds s, ah, and k and how all three of these
sounds can change over time.
Dr Mc. Worther also talks about how print and literacy can hold language back (video 17
minutes) however despite this language can change a lot over time. (19 min 27 seconds).",96,"Hi Rajdai, you did a wonderful job connecting the lecture to your personal history. Your experience with Guyanese Creole is a perfect example of language evolution.

For your next assignments, pay attention to: 

spelling (you misspelled the professor's name)
subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""some examples he gave is"" should be ""are""). 
Additionally, your final sentence regarding print and literacy felt unnecessary; you introduced a new topic at the very end without elaborating on it or connecting it to your previous points about sound change. For your next assignment, focus on wrapping up your main argument rather than adding disconnected facets at the end. "
1,"Watching the first episode of Language Families of the World, I found especially intriguing what Dr. McWhorter had to say about meaning changes at 13:33. He was talking about how words’ meanings are drifting into being new ones all the time, and I can’t agree more with him on that statement. The changes that happen reflect the cultural shifts, social attitudes, and historical events.

When I think about meaning change, I think about my native Ukrainian language. Over time, many words have gained different meanings that can be different from their original ones. Such as the word “подонок”, which was originally used to refer to the literal bottom of an item, and is now used to describe a morally corrupt or despicable person. Another example is the word “бидло”, which used to mean cattle, but has now evolved into a derogatory term for people considered rude or uncultured. While those changes happened decades before I was born, some gained their new meanings in recent years, after the full-scale invasion. Such as “бавовна”, which traditionally referred to cotton, has taken on an ironic meaning associated with explosions on the enemy’s territory. “Кіборг”  is now a symbol of extraordinary resilience and heroism in Ukrainian soldiers. And the word “орки”, once tied mainly to fantasy literature, is now used as a synonym for the enemy, carrying strong emotional and political meaning.

These examples are proof of Dr. McWorter’s point that the meaning change is inevitable. As society changes, everything around it changes to assimilate; humans need to adapt the meanings of the words or come up with new ones.",91,"Hi Valeriia, your examples of semantic shift in Ukrainian are absolutely fascinating and highly relevant. 

However, your essay is too short (266 words) and falls below the 300-word minimum. You need to expand your analysis to meet the requirements. Also, watch out for sentence fragments: you started two sentences with ""Such as..."" ""Such as"" is a connector, so it should join the previous sentence or start a complete thought (e.g., ""One such example is...""). Finally, you misspelled the professor's name as ""McWorter."" "
1,"Language Families of the World is a documentary that introduces the concept of languages and is narrated by Dr. John McWorther, a linguist and author. At video 1, 7 min 19 seconds, Dr. McWorther brings up an idea where “Each generation pronounces sound slightly differently. And then it’s like a game of telephone or operator… after a while you’ve got a complete transformation.” Now this can occur in multiple areas of language, but Dr.McWorther goes in depth on sounds changing. I find this interesting because it’s as if we’re playing telephone in real life. As each generation learns a new word in their language, the pronunciation of different words slightly changes with each generation. With each slight change in pronunciation, the word eventually sounds quite different from the word that language started with. In this situation, a new generation is another person in the game of telephone. I also find it interesting because I relate to the fact in my personal life. My family speaks malayalam fluently and I can understand malayalam. I’m not entirely fluent in malayalam, though I can speak a few words in malayalam. When I pronounce “shower”, “water”, or “rice” in malayalam, it doesn't sound the same as when my mother pronounces it. While I don’t pronounce it the same, it can be understood by others. All in all, I pronounce words in malayalam slightly differently than my mother who is in a different generation than me. My grandparents pronounce words in malayalam slightly differently than my parents, siblings, and myself. I’ve also seen this occur in my life when I was learning Spanish. There would be fluent Spanish speakers in my class and their pronunciation of certain words would be slightly different than that of the teacher’s pronunciation. To understand this phenomenon, “slightly” is the operative word. The changes in sounds have to sound similar, otherwise the individual is just not pronouncing the word correctly in the given language. ",97,"Hi Angelina, great job on this! I particularly enjoyed your final insight: ""slightly"" is the operative word. That was a sophisticated observation! Your personal connection to Malayalam and the generational differences in your family's pronunciation also illustrated this concept perfectly. 

For future assignments, try to avoid using large chunks of direct quotes (like the ""Each generation... complete transformation"" section). Instead, paraphrase these ideas in your own words to demonstrate your understanding and save space for your own analysis. Also, please pay attention to proper noun capitalization; you consistently wrote ""malayalam"" when it should be ""Malayalam."" Finally, remember to spell the professor's name correctly. "
1,"One topic that Dr. John McWhorter discusses in the film that I find particularly intriguing is  the language family tree, and it's really interesting what it is able to reveal about human movement and history. This discussion appears at approximately 19 minutes and 33 seconds, when he introduces how linguistics organizes language into different families.
In this section of the film, Dr. McWhorter explains that languages diversify over time as different human populations migrate. Rather than remaining stagnant, languages gradually split, change, and develop into whole new languages. New forms are also created, which morph into different, distinct language families. Linguists are able to trace these relationships by identifying shared structure, sounds, and vocabulary that all lead back to a certain common ancestral language. The result of this is a family-tree model that visually represents how languages are historically connected.
What I found most interesting about this explanation is how it challenged my idea that just because a country is close to another, they share similar languages. I previously assumed that languages spoken near one another were related, but I couldn't be more wrong. This segment showed me that history, migration, and periods of separation between countries matter much more than the simple location. I realized after this that language diversity reflects complex human stories instead of just neat regional boundaries.",86,"
Hi Daniel, you have grasped the main concept of the ""Language Family Tree"" very well! Your insight about proximity vs. relatedness highlights what Dr. McWhorter means when he says language history is about migration, not just geography. 

However, your essay is too short (221 words). While I appreciate your personal reflection, there needs to be more specific evidence to support your claims. For example, what specific examples from Dr. McWhorter's tour of the continents did you find most convincing? Also, how did you form your previous assumption that neighbors always speak related languages? Elaborating on these details will not only strengthen your argument but also help you easily meet the 300-word requirement. "
1,"In the film titled “Language Families of the World. “Why Are there so Many
Languages?” Season 1, Episode 1. Narrated by John McWhorter, produced by The
Great Courses, 2019.” In precisely (27:51) out of the 30 minute video, Dr. McWorther
states and explains how Basque, a language spoken in a region that straddles France
and Spain is a language that is unrelated to any known language spoken now, despite
being surrounded by languages all from another family. Which in turn, through modern
genetics shows that Basque people are inherently related to the original descendants of
the people of Europe, and that the language was previously spoken throughout the
region. The reason for my interest in this fact, is that I myself have European
decadence, specifically Italian. And when I hear Basque being spoken, it sort of feels
like I'm in a dream where I can't make out the words but something about it seems
familiar, specially because I also speak spanish, which makes the language even more
relatable, like a forgotten memory. However, upon learning that this language has no
relation to any language spoken now, it stunned me, as I would have believed that it
would be related in some way to Spanish or Italian or French, as those countries border
the religion and would have likely influenced something in the language. But after Dr.
McWhorter explained that it was the Basque who were the original descendants of
European people, then I can’t help but wonder how Basque might have made these
languages rise, and how with the mentioned things in the film such as sound separating
languages, just as basque sounds familiar, other languages like spanish might have
originated from it, as the sounds are there, yet the words are so different. Henceforth,
learning this fact about the Basque language made me think how sometimes I view
things one way, and really do not consider the possibility that it is the other way round,
such as Basque being the original descendant of European People, and how even
language isolates have something in common. Making me agree with the theory
proposed by Dr. McWorther, that all languages did originate from one, and that factors
such as sound, the meaning of words, and the fact that languages are inherently going
to change made all the languages in the world slowly drift away. However, maintaining
their similarity deep down",89,"Hi Sebastian, good job connecting the concept of the Basque language to your own background. Describing the language as a 'forgotten memory' is a very creative way to put it! 

There was some confusion regaridng lingusitic history. Specifically, Spanish did not originate from Basque. Also, there are a few formatting and writing issues to address. First, you don't need to include the full title and source of the video in your first sentence; a simple reference is fine. Second, use quotation marks ("" "") when using the exact wording from the video (e.g., ""spoken in a region that straddles France and Spain.""). Third, please proofread for typos and word choices; for example, you used ""decadence"" instead of ""descent"" and ""religion"" instead of ""region."" Finally, when you connected to your personal reflection (""Learning this fact... made me think...""), providing more specific examples would help readers engage with your essay.

Good job on the overall effort. "
1,"The part of this film that I find a lot of interest in takes place at 16 minutes and 30 seconds. In this part of the film Dr. McWhorter brings up William Shakespeare, he mentions how the English language does not seem to make many changes over time, likely due to literacy. It is mentioned how Shakespeare's writings and plays are English and is how English was spoken and how over time, especially within 300,000 years the language can change. I have actually spent a lot of time thinking about this over a few years and I get so curious and lost trying to figure it out. When having to read anything from William Shakespeare I tend to struggle understanding what is being said and what he means. Although it is English it is definitely different then how we speak today. I always wonder how our language has gotten to where it is and even what caused it to change the way it has from when William Shakespeare was writing. I wonder how our language was even before Shakespeare and it amazes me thinking that it somehow was not always around and it had to be invented. How do you just think of words and pass it around and decide it is going it be English, like making up a random word right now and deciding a meaning for it and it becomes a normal word. Language is a very interesting idea and it was interesting in the video. Hearing how these languages may have started and how they have evolved to Shakespeare time and even how it changed from then to now. It is even impressive how these languages would change little things or sounds and would split off and become a different language than where it originated. It is so crazy that one language can have multiple families like the click language having three different families for similar things. ",97,"
Hi Haley, you did a good job summarizing the part on Shakespeare and literacy. I also enjoyed reading your personal curiosity about how words are ""invented."" It is very arbitrary, right?

There are some grammatical errors/typos that need attention. Please proofread for typos and grammatical errors; for example, you used ""different then"" instead of ""than"" and missed possessives like ""Shakespeare's time.""

Additionally, the third sentence (""It is mentioned how Shakespeare's writings ... especially within 300,000 years the language can change) can be misleading; English has not existed for 300,000 years (FYI, Old English was spoken roughly 1,500 yrs ago), so be careful not to confuse general human history with specific language history.

Overall, good job again!"
1,"Change is a common denominator in almost every facet of life. Humans experience
change in our everyday lives, music and movies encounter change, so it would only make sense
that language, as a whole, is no exception. Prior to watching Language Families of the World, I
thought that changes in language consist of things like trends in slang and different accents
people have. However, Dr. McWhorter’s claim that substantial change over time is a
fundamental part of language’s existence is something that I found extremely interesting. At 6
minutes 19 seconds in Language Families of the World, Dr. McWhorter poses the overarching
question of why language changes and how it surpasses thoughts of how day-to-day word choice
evolves. Slightly after this, at 6 minutes 33 seconds, Dr. McWhorter states that language must
change in the same way clouds have to change because it is in their nature. Throughout the
documentary episode, I found the way that Dr. McWhorter explains the slow, but persistent
pronunciation changes from each generation engaging and unique in the way he blended his
examples with his reasoning. The difference in generally thinking that language can change
versus the idea that it must change is complex and somewhat overwhelming to think about for a
prolonged period of time. However, it makes sense once you begin to think about examples in
other aspects of your life and how they are changing because of human interaction. Adaptation
and getting accustomed to new things are vital in most professions, especially healthcare. I am a
Health Science major specifically interested in OBGYN, and, just like language, medicine is
constantly changing because it has to. Sometimes changes occur quickly and other times over the
span of decades, but always because of the presence of humanity and people’s passion in the
field developing new procedures, conditions, or medications.
",99,"Hi Gwen, great job connecting the ""cloud"" analogy to your field of study. Comparing the necessity of language change to the necessity of medical evolution was a thoughtful parallel. 

My only minor suggestion is on phrasing. Some of your sentences are quite long and complex. Breaking them up could make your argument even clearer. "
1,"The part of the movie that really interested me was when McWhorter explained how sounds and enunciation of letters could change throughout time. More specifically, I was surprised when he was talking about how much the “aw” sound was gradually disappearing from our language because of the way people would pronounce words such as caught and raw. He started speaking about this at around the 8:48 mark, and was explaining how a word like sock can change throughout the years because of the difference in the pronunciation of the letters and sounds in the word. He stated that the “aw” in a lot of words was starting to be pronounced more and more like an “ah”. I never thought about this, but I am one of the people who pronounce words with the “aw” sound in them like an “ah”. I am from south Georgia and that is how a lot of people talk where I am at. When he used the word “caught” as an example, I smiled a little bit because I definitely pronounce it more like “cot”. It is just really crazy to think that certain words can die out simply because of the way people pronounce them. Watching a video like this honestly makes me want to listen to how I speak on a day to day basis and try to find out what words I pronounce a little differently than what was intended. I am sure that I would find a lot more instances of me speaking a little country. Honestly, I think that there are more instances of certain sounds within words changing throughout the years in the south than there is in the northern part of the country. This would be a great thing to study and do an analysis on. The results of that analysis would offer a lot of information on the dialect and changes within word pronunciation within certain groups of people.",96,"Great job on this, Caleb! 

You've perfectly identified the vowel shift, and it is fascinating that you noticed this in your own South Georgia speech! 

For your future assignments, try to elevate your vocabulary slightly; phrases like ""it is just really crazy"" are a bit too conversational for academic writing. Also, expanding on why you think the South changes more would have been a great way to deepen the essay. "
1,"The topic that Dr. McWorther brings up that I find intriguing about language is when he was dissecting basic words that we use each day. At the time 15:'07'' and on in the video, he was describing how bra came from brassiere and how everything traced back to short (which he did say very funny). I find this so interesting because as a kid, my parents would make certain words up to mess with my sister and I and keep us from saying bra because it was embarrassing to say in public. We would call it the ""ladies"" or just even say ""blub"" which I have no idea how we got to that from ""ladies"". I like how he actually uses different pronunciations in this video to help better understand what he is saying. It makes it easier for me to understand all the traces of the words and their different families. I also enjoyed that in the beginning he mentions that there are technically 6000 languages but the splitters believe in 7000 which seems more dramatic to anyone hearing that. I don't truly know how we could have so many languages in the world, seeing as English and Spanish seem so common in the United States. I always had interest in continuing learning Spanish after High School so maybe this video is encouraging me, with the way he dissects the words and how they still kind of keep the meaning they originally had. It was very strange listening to it while taking the quiz too because of all the random noises he was making, but going back and seeing the connections to the words and fully understanding everything made it feel more connected and easier to learn. I truly think this video makes the viewer question their own language while learning more in depth about how other languages can connect. ",96,"Hi Kathryn, you did a good job identifying the ""bra"" example and the ""lumbers vs. splitters"" debate. Your personal anecdote about using code words like ""blub"" to avoid saying ""bra"" was relatable, too!

However, your writing style is often too conversational for an academic assignment. For example, instead of saying your parents would ""mess with"" you, aim for a more academic tone. Also, for your next assignments, try to be careful with several grammatical and spelling errors: 

""...mess with my sister and I"" should be ""my sister and me""
You misspelled the professor's name as McWorther (it is McWhorter) 
You do not need to capitalize ""High School."" "
1,"I found it interesting how the writing down of language and growing literacy slow the changes that are made to it.  In my mind, I have always assumed that the writing down of language is something that was always positive and created more opportunities for people to put their own personal touch on the language they engage with. Apparently, contrary to my thought process, when a language is written down, it greatly slows the changes as it kind of creates a set of rules that people will follow. Dr. McWorther also mentions that along with the documentation of language classist assumptions are made (17:13) which, while I had never considered that does make sense as when one cannot or does not follow the prescribed set of rules for written language laid before them, whether it is because they are unaware/ do not understand them or something else, it is common for those around them to make the conclusion that they are somehow lesser than due to their ability to write or read. With the way that the English language, for instance, has changed over the years, or more specifically, how little it has changed due to writing and literacy, one could, in theory, have a conversation with Shakespeare and understand what he is saying, regardless of the fact that he lived more than 400 years ago. While the writing of Shakespeare may be different from how we currently speak and write in English, there is still enough commonality that when reading the works he created, it is possible to glean the meaning behind them. When Dr. McWorther begins talking about “Black Country English” (18:03), he demonstrates how quickly and easily language can be changed and evolved when not written and given time to grow and flow with the people who speak it. As time passes, they make changes to things when speaking that they will understand in a way that just is not done in written language.",97,"Hi Shianne, you accurately captured the lecture's main point about how writing ""freezes"" language change. I particularly enjoyed your insights on prescriptivism. 

For your next assignments, pay attention to your sentence structure. You have a massive sentence in the middle of the essay (""Dr. McWorther also mentions...""). This makes it difficult to follow your logic; you might want to break complex thoughts like this into 2 or 3 shorter, clearer sentences. Additionally, please spell the professor's name correctly (McWhorter, not McWorther). "
1,"In Video 1, at 6:20, Dr. McWorther discusses the idea in linguistics that language is inherently changeable. He compares the idea of languages to that of clouds, and how clouds must change just like language must change. He describes how these languages became distinct, showing how if a group of speakers of a language broke off from the main group, their sounds would drift slowly accross generations until the point that the languages are no longer the same. He notes that these changes do not happen quickly, but over a period of hundreds, or even thousands of years. I find this topic of language drift and sound change over time interesting, because I feel like it is an important aspect of linguistics study, and as a linguistics minor, I feel like I can utilize this knowledge in a potential future career. I would like to attend graduate school for some sort of public health or social advocacy field. In this context, I feel as if sound change is relevant in a modern sense when it comes to immigrants and learning second languages. For those learning second languages, sounds and words within the new language one is learning can be challenging to properly pronounce, leading to issues in communication with other, more fluent speakers. More impactufully, though, is the stigmatism that these second language speakers can face in professional settings such as doctor's offices or the workplace. Speakers of second languages in settings like these often face worse care, prejudice, or even denial due to their challenges with speaking their non native language. In a future career, I feel as if I can use knowledge learned in this course about how sounds change accross different languages to help marginalized people in these professional settings get better access to care and support. ",95,"
Hi Levi, you've done a great job connecting the theoretical concept of sound shift to real-world issues. Your point about how L2 speakers face discrimination is a powerful application of sociolinguistics. 

For your next assignments, try to vary your sentence structure more. You used the phrases ""I feel like"" or ""I feel as if"" frequently in this short essay. Using different transitions might help. Also, please proofread for vocabulary and spelling. You used the word ""stigmatism"" when you likely meant ""stigma."" Also, you misspelled ""across,"" ""impactfully,"" and ""McWhorter."" "
1,"A fact that Dr.McWorther brought up that I found especially intriguing about language was that many of the world’s languages are developments from a single initial language (1:31), which then, later evolved and changed into different language families. Language is not created independently, but rather changes over time as people migrate and interact with others, and due to these changes, languages are split into new ones, creating language families. Because of their shared origin, many languages have similar words, patterns, and sounds. Dr.McWorther uses Spanish and French to explain such fact, he talks about how luna and lune (10:03), which are moon in each respective language have noticeable similarities, but only changing the sound. I find this interesting because I speak Portuguese, and when I started learning French, I was surprised by how similar it was. Many words looked and sounded similar, and sentence structures would often follow patterns I already recognized, which wasn’t the case when I was learning English. The film helped me understand that this was not a coincidence, but rather the result of what was being discussed, since both languages evolved from Latin. I will say that this made more confident while learning French, as it gave me a familiar feeling and also made it easier. Another fact that I found intriguing was the fact that there are approximately six to seven thousand languages spoken in the world, before learning this through the film, I had greatly underestimated the number of languages that exist. I had never fully considered how diverse human communication truly is or how many cultures and histories are represented through language. It is because of this that I began to appreciate the value of language and the need to preserve it because it is being lost. Overall, the film was able to change my understanding of language, I now understand the complexity of it.",97,"
Hi Brunna, you did a great job applying the lecture concepts to your own life. Your comparison of learning French versus learning English is a perfect example of how language families work! 

For your next assignments, please proofread your work for spelling and grammar: 

You misspelled the professor's name
""...this made more confident"" should be ""...this made me more confident."" 
""explain such fact"" should be ""explain such a fact."" 
""...spoken in the world, before learning this..."" should be separated by a period or semicolon."
1,"At the very beginning of the video, Dr. John McWhorter begins to explain that all modern
languages likely originated from a single original language. I found this idea especially interesting
because I had never really considered how so many languages came to exist. I had always assumed that
the languages we speak today originated from multiple unrelated languages. One part of the video that
stood out to me was when Dr. John McWhorter explained how pronunciation changes over time and
how this has contributed to the way languages developed. In the video he pointed out that many
Americans pronounce “raw fish” as “rah fish,” or say they “cot a fish” instead of “caught a fish” (Video 1,
9:14). After this example, he then explained how the sound ‘aw’ could turn into ‘oo’ which can later turn
into more of an ‘u’ sound (Video 1, 9:33). He emphasized that these subtle changes happen naturally
and unconsciously as people speak. I noticed an example of this in my own life as well. After hearing
people on social media, movies, or in everyday conversations pronounce words differently (whether
they have a lisp or are just pronouncing something incorrectly), I slowly start to say the word in that way
as well. I rarely notice this until I always pronounce the word differently and people start asking me why
I am pronouncing the word that way. An example of a word that I began to pronounce differently
because of a television show I was watching was the word “sorry.” For a while I was pronouncing it as
“sore-y” and many people quickly pointed this out to me. It wasn’t until later that I realized I was saying
this because the main character in a show I was watching was Canadian and this is how she pronounced
the word. The portion of the video included above as well as my personal example further supports Dr.
John McWhorter’s idea that all languages come from a single original language.",98,"
Fantastic job on this, Mila! 

Your personal example about picking up the Canadian pronunciation of ""sorry"" is a perfect illustration of how media and exposure can motivate subtle sound changes. 

One minor thing: You state that your example ""supports Dr. McWhorter's idea that all languages come from a single original language."" While your example proves that sounds change, it doesn't necessarily prove the Single Origin Hypothesis itself. 

Excellent work overall!"
1,"One topic that Dr. McWorther brought up that intrigued me was the fact that sounds change so often within a language, which completely created new words with new meanings. At 13:58 he talks about the Ukrainian word “mmreh” meaning “short,” developed over time into the common English words of “pretzel, ‘bra”, and “merry.” This part of the movie really struck out to ,e because he mentioned that due to people’s physical circumstances, like dentures for instance, can cause a person to say a word differently, which could become an entirely different word. For me, my father has a set of fake teeth that are almost like dentures which causes him to pronounce some words differently. ",81,"Hi Jana, you identified a specific example from the lecture and linked it to a personal detail about your father's dental work, which is a relevant connection to how physiology affects speech. 

However, this submission is under the word count. For your next assignments, you need to expand your thoughts significantly. For example, I'd like to see more specific examples from your essay. You mentioned that your father pronounces words differently because of his teeth. Which words specifically? How does his pronunciation differ from yours? Describing that would help you meet the length requirement. "
1,"One fact that Dr. McWhorter explains that I find interesting is that all languages were
built off of the same initial language (Video 1 minute 29 seconds). McWhorter explains the idea
that all languages likely developed from the same, singular original language can be
controversial. This is because some think that languages must have emerged multiple times in
different parts of the world. However, McWhorter explains that this can be disproven because
there has never been a documented group of humans that was mute or didn’t speak at all.
McWhorter explains that speech is a species wide trait for Homo sapiens, which means that it is
something humans naturally possess the ability to do. He continues on to explain that the
singular original human language most likely originated in East Africa and developed into the
seven thousand modern fully developed languages in the world today.
This is interesting to think about because of how diverse languages are today. I have
friends who speak different languages other than English, such as French, Spanish, Italian, and
Hindi. I am only fluent in English, but from listening to people speak other languages, I have
noticed that languages can drastically differ in the way they sound. I have noticed that languages
such as Italian and Spanish sound similar sometimes and can recognize words from both
languages that have similar sounds and meanings. An example of this I have noticed is the word
for telephone sounds very similar in both Spanish and Italian. However, it is hard to imagine that
all languages, no matter how different from each other they are now, can all date back to one
initial language.
As an Elementary Education major, this is relevant to my future profession because I
will most likely teach students with different linguistic backgrounds than my own in the",99,"Great job on this, Grace! Your connection between the Single Origin Hypothesis and the ""deficit lens"" in education is fascinating. A quick tip to make your future arguments even stronger: when you mention linguistic similarities (like the word for ""telephone""), go ahead and write the actual words to provide concrete evidence for your reader. "
1,"A topic that I find especially intriguing is when Dr. McWorther started discussing that
“language is inherently changeable” (Video 6 minutes, 24 seconds). This discussion is
based on the theory that there was only one single language when humans first
existed, but that as humans moved around their speech started to drift apart until it is
not the same language at all. He mentions that this changeability is “completely
ingrained in how languages work”.
The thing I found incredibly interesting is that he says this changeability is difficult to
notice in one lifespan. He later mentions that the change in the meaning of words is
also a way to see languages drifting apart (Video 13 minutes, 44 seconds). I think
these two aspects can be mixed to recognize when a language might start to drift
apart into two, specially with dialects in the Spanish language.
For example, I was born in Cuba and speak Spanish, however one of my friends is
Colombian and she also speaks Spanish. Oftentimes, I ask her to repeat sentences
because she either uses words I don’t recognize or the way she pronounces things
makes it hard for me to understand. At one point she asked me for a “liga” (hair tie)
but in Cuba’s version of Spanish you say “felpa”, causing a misunderstanding
between the both of us. Another word example would be with skirts, she says “falda”,
but I say “salla”.
Even though Dr.McWorther focuses more on the difference in sounds since it is
considered one of the most difficult changes to detect (Video 7 minutes, 20 seconds),
I still found it interesting that within the same language but different countries you can
still see the changeability of language because of different regions or being
separated. This difference in just words, makes me curious to how past Cubans
would have called those objects or pronounced the words different.
It also piques my interest in names and how pronunciation differs throughout time
and languages. I have had experience with this, where a first language English person
pronounces both e’s in Elena different but in Spanish, they are pronounced like the
English letter a. Elena is a common name in Cuba and Dr. McWorther showed how
easily as time passes a sound can change, making me curious how a common name
like Elena might have change through lifetimes.",99,"Elena, this is a great reflection that connects the movie's main points to your personal linguistic inquiry. I LOVED that you shared your experiences and specific examples regarding lexical differences between Cuban and Colombian Spanish. Although the video mainly focused on sound variation, lexical differences among varieties (i.e., dialects) are also a major area of inquiry in linguistics. The change may be due to regional factors (like your examples: Cuba vs. Colombia), generational factors, or social factors! 

For your next assignments, please pay close attention to your word choices; for example, you repeatedly used ""specially"" when you meant ""especially,"" and you wrote ""pronounced the words different"" instead of ""differently."" 

Again, with your specific examples, you showcased a strong understanding of Dr. McWorther's concepts. Great job. "
1,"In the time stamp of 5:56, Dr. McWorther talks about how language began with one
because it’s a species wide trait and there is no evidence of humans who haven’t or don’t speak.
He starts asking questions like “If you have one language and it becomes 7,000, and how in the
world did you get all of these? Why aren’t we all just speaking that same language? Why does
language have to change?” He says it's because language is inherently changeable, meaning it's
inevitable that language will change. He explains this with an example that “if one group of
humans splits off from another one, then their versions of the language start drifting away, just
like clouds, until they are no longer the same language at all.” He goes on to talk about how it is
hard to detect this within a lifespan, but is completely ingrained in how languages work. Which
stems from his next point that each generation pronounces sounds slightly different. I find this
intriguing because I actually never thought of languages in that way. I never realized that all
languages technically stem from one specific language. By actually learning this information, I
am in complete shock, I never knew that languages were as similar as they are or even as
different as they are. I’d expect each language to be different in certain countries and then in
specific areas such as slavic, hispanic, asian, and muslim to be the same. But that is not the case.
Even though they could have similar tones or sounds their grammar could be completely
different. This reminds me of my diverse background because I am half Dominican and half
Israeli/Moldovan, but even though my dad is Moldovan he doesn’t speak Moldovan he speaks
Russian, which is my first language. By doing some research I just found out that Moldovan is
linguistically the same language as Romanian. Which is a language I have never heard. This
brings me to the question that if my father is Moldovan why doesn’t he speak Romanian. I found
out that when he was born in Moldova, Russia owned that territory which is why he speaks
Russian and not Romanian. I have lots of friends who are Russian and Ukrainian, so when they
speak Ukrainian I can sometimes pick up certain things. But eventually, I find out that my
interpretation of what I thought they said is completely different and that is because Russian and
Ukrainian have major differences in their vocabulary, pronunciation, and letters, despite both
being East Slavic languages with similar grammar. This expresses what Dr. McWorther said that
language is inherently changeable, like even though languages derive from the same region
doesn’t mean that the language will be the same.",95,"
Hi Mirel, this is a fascinating reflection. You offered a perfect personal example of how sociolinguistics works in the real world. 

However, for future assignments, try to avoid using large chunks of direct quotes (e.g., the long block starting with ""If you have one language...""). Instead, paraphrase these ideas in your own words. Additionally, please pay attention to capitalization: proper adjectives such as Slavic, Hispanic, Asian, and Muslim should be capitalized. Finally, remember to spell the professor's name correctly. "
1,"One topic that I found very interesting is Dr. John McWhorter’s explanation of how
words change form and meaning over time through everyday use. At around 11:46, Dr.
McWhorter discusses the suffix “ly” and explains that it originally comes from the word “like.”
He gives the example that “slowly” once meant “slow like,” and that “only” originally came
from the phrase “one like.” In the same section, he explains how the prefix “for” in the word
“forgive” reflects an older meaning of “giving” something up, so to forgive someone is literally
to give up one’s anger toward them. He even says that “for” doesn’t even mean anything and that
it must have been a word that meant something in the past but now it is just a prefix. I never
would have thought that the word forgive was broken down into two words at some point.
I find this especially interesting because it shows how language is not deliberately
designed but instead changes naturally as speakers adapt it to their own needs. Realizing that
common words like “only” and “slowly” originated from longer phrases that people used to use
makes language feel much more complex and interesting than I previously thought. This
connects to my own life because I hear and use slang and shortened expressions constantly in
everyday conversation, especially among me and my friends. Whenever I am playing a video
game or playing sports with my friends we always say things in short slang sentences but yet we
understand what we are saying because we communicate so much this way. It's just very strange
and interesting how languages evolve and adapt constantly every day and yet so many people
can understand and learn it despite how much we've changed it.",92,"Hi Matteo, you selected a great specific example with the etymology of ""forvie"" and the suffix ""-ly."" 

However, you missed the word count. To avoid this (& to strengthen your essay), try to be more specific in your personal reflection. You mentioned using ""short slang sentences"" while playing video games, but you didn't give examples. What specific slang words do you use? Including the actual vocabulary you use with your friends will push you over the word count and make your argument much more compelling. "
1,"One topic Dr. McWhorter brought up that I found intriguing is the African language families
and click languages. This comes up in Video 1, at around 22 minutes and 21 seconds. He
originally started off by saying that Africa has four language families, but the Click
languages, which is one of those four, comprises three families. I found this interesting
because knowing little to nothing about Click languages, I thought click sounds belonged
to just one family, but instead it belongs to multiple. This means that there are different
variations of clicks because different groups developed or borrowed them over time. This
goes back to the point McWhorter made about language always changing and spreading.
McWhorter also explains how click sounds function as consonants, and this shows that no
language is simple; all languages are complex in their own right. This relates to my
personal experiences because I’ve grown up hearing different varieties of English around
me due to accents, slang, formal/informal language, and where someone was from. In
English, there are multiple words for just one thing; it all depends on where you’re from for
which version of the word you’ll use. For example, a shopping cart may be called a buggy,
and a popsicle may be called a squeeze or a lily dilly in different parts of North America.
Another topic or fact that Dr. McWhorter brought up that I found intriguing is that there are
6,000-7,000 different languages in the world. This comes up in Video 1, at around 0:45. He
goes on to say that there are 7,000 languages in the world, but he believes there are only
6,000 because he’s a lumper, meaning he groups related languages into one. I find this
interesting because I probably can’t even name no more than 20 different languages, so
having 6,000-7,000 different languages is interesting and a quite bit insane to me. At the
same time though, there are many cultures around the world and languages are a major
part of culture, so it’s not largely surprising. This fact relates to my future career passion in
Social Work. It’s best to know more than one language when interviewing families,
especially when it’s a family that comes from a different cultural background.
",98,"Hi Ta'Niyah, this is a fantastic essay! You did a great job connecting specific linguistic concepts to specific, concrete examples from your own life. For your future assignments, I suggest you choose just one topic and expand on it more deeply, rather than covering two different points. For example, I would have loved to see you expand more on the connection to Social Work. Additionally, be careful with double negative (""I probably can't even name no more than..."" should be ""I probably can't name more than...""). "
1,"I find it very interesting me when Dr. McWhorther starts speaking about how sounds
changing leads to different variations in language and the development of it into various words.
Dr. McWhorther starts speaking about this at 7:22 in the video to around 11:23. He gives
multiple examples of different sounds developing into different words and languages. For
example, he explains the different “oo,” and “u,” sounds and the similarity/differences of the
Spanish word “luna”, and the French pronunciation of moon is “lune.” He also speaks about the
similar tones and variations of the “s” sound that developed into, “zh, sh, zh.” As a mandarin
speaker I found these sounds sounded very similar to many of the different tones and characters
that are spoken in the language. For example, there are many dialects in China that have distinct
differences but still share most words and pronunciations. The progression of different sounds
throughout history can be seen when comparing Mandarin and Cantonese. Cantonese seemingly
branches off enough of Mandarin compared to other dialects like Sichuanese to identify
linguistically as a different language. An example of a similar word would be the Mandarin
pronunciation of water is “shui,” while in Cantonese it is “seoi.” I find the idea of sounds
changing leading to the development of these two distinct languages. As someone who has
grown around both languages particularly around some of my friends that speak Cantonese, I am
able to understand some of the words that are being said because of the similarities in sound,
which leads to similar but distinct pronunciations. It is very similar to the example that was used
in the video, comparing the pronunciation of the word “Moon” in French and Spanish. The
different sounds from “sh,” and “se,” was what made the distinct difference of the word water in
Cantonese and Mandarin.
",97,"Hi Daniel, this is a great application of the course material. I loved that you compared Mandarin and Cantonese in your own way. 

However, you need to be careful with your proofreading. Specifically, double-check your typos (""I find it very interesting me"" -- Delete ""me""), spelling (the professor's name), and grammar (""The different sounds..was what made..."" should be ""were what made"")."
1,"I felt especially intrigued when Dr. McWorther brought up how words' end up with new meanings over time (at 13:31 in the film). He explains how new words can form over time from others as the sounds they use get replaced. Specifically, he talks about how this ends up causing languages to change into others using an example of English's distant ancestor of Ukrainian being the source of 3 different English words. I mainly find this interesting because it reveals to me how various different languages could have come to exist or how existing languages could have diverted/split into different dialects as well. This directly relates to an interest of mine in the Japanese language. For example, Japan's region of Kansai, which consists of cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, utilizes a unique Kansai dialect instead of the standardized Japanese used in most other regions of Japan. While most of the vocabulary remains the same as regular Japanese, there are a few words and phrases that hold different meanings. For example, the words ""Aho: アホ"" and ""Baka: バカ"" are both used in Kansai and standard Japanese. However, their meanings can change depending on where you are specifically. ""Aho"" in Kansai basically is calling someone an idiot in a jokingly or playful way, whereas ""Baka"" is the same thing but much more offensive, as if you actually mean it. In standard Japanese, or in a place like Tokyo, these meanings are completely flipped. Instead, ""Baka"" is the joking or playful word and ""Aho"" is the offensive word. This example mainly shows how as the Japanese language developed over time, its vocabulary has branched out into different styles across Japan with each dialect altering the preexisting words to  fit their specific dialect. It also specifically relates to me as if I were to go to a Kansai city like Osaka and call a Japanese friend of mine a ""Baka"", they may take that to heart instead of my joking intent all because I made a slight mistake in my word usage.",97,"
Hi Nicholas, great job on this. Your comparison of the Kansai dialect versus Standard Japanese was very relevant to the course material. 

However, there are a few mechanical errors to fix, including grammar (""how words' end up""; it should be the plural ""words end up"") and spelling (McWhorter). "
1,"Dr. McWhorter’s lecture on the nature of language, language changes, and
language family distribution was intriguing overall. However, the topic on language
change was by far the most appealing to me.
Dr. McWhorter begins this section at Film 1, 6 min 21 seconds. He mentions that
language cannot help but change, especially when groups of people split off from each
other. After long periods of time, there will be noticeable differences because of slight
alterations in pronunciation that eventually accumulated. Dr. McWhorter at Film 1, 8
min 2 seconds, continues this discussion through the example of how the word “sock”
could become “jue” because of small changes in the pronunciation of each part of the
word, “s”, “ah”, and “k”.
This subject was interesting to me because, as Dr. McWhorter mentions, it is not
something that we notice right away, it may also be hard to believe. Despite that, I really
understood what he was saying throughout this section and the breakdown of the
examples he used made it entirely clear to me. It is fascinating that such slight
distinctions in how we pronounce not just a word, but even just parts of it, can create a
whole new sounding one. Although, this does not correlate exactly with what Dr.
McWhorter explained, it reminds me of when younger children struggle to pronounce a
word. To aid in this struggle, they will typically alter the word by removing letters or
pronouncing it differently. Inevitably, their parents will pick up on their version of the
word and may begin to use it too because of convenience, and in some families, this
may even stick for the remainder of their lives. This seems to demonstrate how easy it is
for sounds in words to change.
I experienced this myself with my younger sister. When she was beginning to
learn how to speak, there were some words that she could not pronounce correctly.
One of these words was ‘sofa’, and instead of saying it the proper way, she would
change the “s” to a “f”. Hence, instead of ‘sofa’, the word became ‘fofa’, and my family,
although it is not proper, still pronounces it that way because it became habit.
",100,"Hi Sophie, you did a great job engaging deeply with the sound variation, which was one of the movie's main elements. Your personal connection to your sister's pronunciation was also brilliant. 

Excellent work! "
1,"The topic that I found the most interesting, as discussed by Dr. McWorther, was the number of language families scattered throughout the world and the relative randomness of their dispersal. At minute 21:30, he goes on to explain that the relatively small island of Papua New Guinea houses 25 different language families, whereas Australia only houses two. The immense contrast in landmass and population would have led me to believe the number of language families would have been reversed. I can personally relate to this as my family is also from the relatively small island of Cuba. The primary language spoken in Cuba is Spanish, which I know fluently; however, whenever my grandmother talks about her childhood in the countryside, she mentions that the older generations used to speak languages she'd never heard of. Her neighbor growing up would normally speak Spanish to everyone else; however, when speaking to her family, they would only speak Creole. Their family had lived in Cuba for generations; however, they never lost their Haitian roots and passed them down as much as possible. Santería was also very popular in the smaller countryside towns, and my grandmother explained to me that the chants and songs recited were in a language called Lucumí, which I later found out originated from Yoruba. When I heard that more than one language was spoken on a fairly isolated and poorly educated island, I was immediately intrigued. It fascinates me how many generations can pass down the languages of their roots. I assume that the same takes place in Papua New Guinea, as from what I recall, out of all the language families Dr. McWhorton listed, Papua New Guinea had one of the most. It takes a certain amount of dedication and ancestral pride to carry and continue the forgotten languages of one's culture.",97,"Hi Mia, this is a wonderful reflection. I particularly enjoyed your mentioning of Lucumí and Haitian Creole usage in the countryside. For your future assignments, be careful with spelling. You misspelled the professor's name twice. Also, try to vary your transitions; you used the word ""however"" three times in three consecutive sentences, which makes the reading a bit repetitive. You can use ""On the other hand,"" ""Yet,"" or ""Conversely"" to vary your flow. "
1,"In the Languages Families of the World film, Dr. McWorther brings up the fact that the English language has remained consistent within the past several centuries, using examples of William Shakespeare’s plays. At this time, he says that “That language is English, and we feel like, how much does language really change?” (Video 1, 16 min 20 seconds). This example of William Shakespeare stood out to me because I have read plays like The Tempest and found much of the language difficult to understand, yet Dr. McWhorter pointed out that the main ideas of his plays is still accessible. It is interesting to notice how words and sounds have changed since then but have remained similar enough to still grasp the main idea. Furthermore, his answer to this question relates to his idea that print and literacy are fundamental components that preserve the guidelines and structures of a language. He compares print and literacy to a stick that prevents a wheel from spinning freely, thereby helping to regulate change over time. On the other hand, Dr. McWorther speaks about unwritten English and how these dialects become prone to rapid changes. At 18 minutes, Dr. McWorther mentions his favorite English dialect, “Black Country English.” He says, “The way they speak English in the black country… is so different from the way English is frozen on the page…” (Video 1, 18 min 22 seconds). He describes examples of basic words like “You can’t” to sound like “Yow Caw.” This was interesting to learn about because I never thought about how fundamental literacy and print is to the longevity of ideas and language. Perhaps I never thought of this because I never lived in a time without electronics, journals, and in general an age of discovery. This made me look at language a little differently than before, reflecting on the differences between present times and past times and how such changes have altered the way language is progressing and evolving.",94,"
Hi Katarzyna, you did a great job contrasting the stability of written English with the rapid change of oral dialects like ""Black Country English."" I particularly liked your personal connection to reading The Tempest. 

For your next assignment, please be careful with the spelling of the speaker's name (it's McWhorter) and double-check your subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""how fundamental literacy and print are,"" not ""is""). 

Good work again! "
1,"In Language Families of the World, one of the more interesting facts that Dr. McWorther discussed is the geographic impact that results in the diversity of languages becoming not exactly evenly spread across the world. Language diversity is somehow influenced by the pattern of roles or relationships instead of advancements of culture. Approximately at around the 21 minutes into the video, the discussion of this topic occurs. 

Dr. McWhorter emphasizes that there are a large amount of languages with distinct language, like New Guinea for example, while other areas such as Europe, that are more vast, may not have as many relative to its size. At this timestamp, Dr. McWhorter explains an impressive sixth of all of the world’s languages are derived from New Guinea itself, even though the population is relatively small in contrast to the rest of the world. Additionally, languages can separate over time organically without the effects of the influence from writing systems or large empires. 

This is incredibly interesting due to the fact that it contrasts the belief of many that technology has a great effect on the diversity of linguistic development. It also combats the assumption regarding cultural complexity with linguistic diversity. But rather, the illustration of a natural process for the change in language is illustrated by McWhorter. The small communities that are isolated result in more diversity for language changes rather than communities that are more mutual or better connected. Thus, language is able to evolve with humanity dynamically with social history. 

The presented idea aligns with my interests academically. Communication is a barrier that affects patient care. As a biomedical engineering student aiming to have a career in medicine, the career aspiration requires an understanding that many of the languages vary heavily despite being in a region that could be far from other geographic language origins. A better understanding of the variation of language is an example of an important emphasis in healthcare. Despite language interpreters being available for improved patient care, language structure variations may directly impact the manner the patient describes or understands their symptoms or pain. 

In conclusion,Dr. McWhorter’s display of the unbalanced language sharing emphasizes the impact of geography, human history, and even interactions have on language. This allowed a better understanding that a unique engineering of thought is represented within each language. ",95,"
Hi Ryan, you have written a thoughtful essay that makes a very unique connection between linguistic diversity & your field of Biomedical engineering. I agree with you -- different language varieties will affect how pain is described. 

However, there are some areas that need refinement. First, be more precise with your timestamp; the specific discussion occurs closer to 21:30 rather than just ""around 21 minutes."" Second, proofread for repetitive phrasing to make your sentences smoother. For example, writing ""The illustration of a natural process ... is illustrated by McWhorter"" is redundant. Lastly, remember to use ""number"" instead of ""amount"" when discussing countable nouns like languages (""a large number of languages""). 

Overall, great job! "
1,"One topic Dr McWorther brought up that I found especially interesting and something I had not considered before was how print and literacy can dramatically slow down language evolution. At timestamp 16:55, Dr McWorther states that the existence of written language and that language on paper makes people think of the language as more concrete and unchangeable. Since written language is not as easily changed as spoken language (hence the phrase ""set in stone""), it ""holds the language back"", as McWorther says, and leaves little room for evolution of words, sounds, or meaning. Though language can still most definitely change through print, it is not nearly as fast, dramatic, or as widespread as spoken word.

I find this interesting because the impact of print and literacy on language evolution is something I had never considered before. Though I've taken other anthropology and language classes before, I had only learned the way spoken language spreads and changes rather than the ways it is prevented from doing so. I also find this particularly interesting (as someone who enjoys anthropology and philosophical debates) because it forces me to wonder if the creation of printed language and increased literacy was a good or bad thing. Some may think of it as a good thing, as it created a permanent and firm reference for whatever language was being spoken. There would be no room for debate, and there would certainly be much less miscommunication/confusion between those who supposedly speak the same language. However, this may also be considered a bad thing if you take into account the classism and restricted rates of literacy among many societies of people. Depending on social status, not everyone was able to or taught how to read or interpret written language or symbols, creating a larger divide between people who spoke the same language, splitting the language further apart.",98,"
Hi Julianna, this is a great reflection. Your point about the double-edged sword of literacy is excellent; it connects directly to the sociolinguistic concept that prescriptive grammar often becomes a tool of exclusion. 

For your next assignments, however, I'd like to see more specific examples to strengthen your argument. For example, you can mention Shakespeare (as Dr. McWhorter did) to illustrate how writing preserves old forms, or cite specific historical instances where literacy created class barriers. Lastly, please double-check your spelling; you misspelled the professor's name. "
1,"In the film, the topic that Dr. McWorther brings up that I found the most interesting was when he mentioned that language is always subject to change (Language Families of the World, 6:23). Dr. McWorther says that language must change. He also uses a metaphor that language should change similarly to how clouds change every day. He mentions that language changing is like a game of telephone where each generation begins to change the sounds and pronunciation of words (Language Families of the World, 7:25). I find this interesting because although it may seem like common sense that language is ever evolving it’s fascinating how humans overtime change how words sound. 

As someone who speaks English, I can’t imagine pronouncing a word like “sock” differently even 30 years from now, but perhaps many years from now, the sound for this word could change very easily. I personally understand how this is certainly true because recently I realized that I was pronouncing “Star Wars” incorrectly. Instead of saying Wars as in “worz” I was pronouncing it like “Was” but with an r instead of an s. My friend was the one who corrected me one day when I was talking about “Star Wars”. I realized that my Spanish-speaking family has been pronouncing Star Wars incorrectly, which made me learn how to pronounce it incorrectly for many years, and I still pronounce it wrong sometimes to this day. Now I understand Dr. McWorther when he was explaining to his audience about how language is like a game of telephone because you can easily start to change the sound of words. For example,  the way that my family changed the sound for the word “Wars” caused me to pronounce the word “Wars” incorrectly. 

From my own personal experiences, Spanglish feels like its own language because it tends to pronounce the sounds for English words differently. In the module 1 readings, I remember that native speakers, when learning another language, try to use the sounds they use in their native language in the new language they are learning, similar to Spanish speakers learning English or vice versa. I feel like this behavior tends to change how words sound over time.",97,"Hi Alejandra, this is a great reflection! Your personal example of pronouncing ""Star Wars"" differently because of your family's Spanish influence connects beautifully with Dr. McWhorter's ""telephone game"" analogy. Also, great job relating the Module 1 readings to your personal experience with Spanglish! 

However, be careful with your phrasing. You used the word ""incorrectly"" five times in one paragraph. In linguistics, we try to avoid labeling variety or dialect differences as ""incorrect""; instead, we might say it is a ""non-standard"" pronunciation or an ""accent variation."" Additionally, you misspelled the professor's name, and you should combine ""over time"" into two words (not ""overtime,"" which refers to extra work hours). "
1,"7:39

In this specific instance, Dr. John McWhorter decides to utilize an example in the form of the word sock. He uses this example to describe how the use of sounds and how society may say them in correlation to letters changes drastically over a long period of time. He begins by dissecting the word sock into the sounds ""s"", ""ah"" and ""k"". He goes on to explain how these sounds that we correlate to the word sock could change drastically and make the word seem foreign in due time, like the ""s"" to a ""sh"" to a ""zh"" or the ""k"" eventually becoming a ""gh"" before not being pronounced at all any more. I find this extremely interesting, as being a major in American Sign Language, one major topic that has been brought up numerous times is how signs - and how they may be used - differs even from towns due to sign language's own version of ""accents"". While typically, this does not cause complete misunderstanding between accents - just as a Floridian would still understand how a Texan may speak - it is extremely interesting in how sign language can have a shift in how signs are ""pronounced"" just between towns. Hearing him not only identify these accents - for English obviously - but to show how the change in pronunciation does not merely exist between regions of a country, but pronunciation changes within these regions over time as well. I find this extremely interesting. Though he seems entirely disinterested in it - slang is the largest example I can think of in which I experience something like this in my day to day life. Slang appears to be a rapidly shifting version of this change in which terms seem to change even as soon as monthly. This seems to be a very interesting difference, being able to see pronunciation change - not only at this rapid pace - but at a slower and larger pace as well.",95,"Hi Christian, you made a fascinating connection between spoken sound shifts and regional dialects in ASL. One clarification to make here is that, as Dr. McWhorter explained, the sound shifts were not correlated with letters; rather, they reflect how people pronounce sounds differently over time. Also, I'd like to see more specific examples of your opinions. For example, what kind of slang have you noticed in terms of language change? 

For your future assignment, please review your writing for a few issues: 1) You repeated the phrase ""I find this extremely interesting"" -- you may try to vary your sentence structure to avoid repetition; 2) There is an incomplete sentence in the middle (""Hearing him not only... over time as well.""), which lacks a main verb; 3) Be careful with word choice: you wrote Dr. McWhorter seemed 'disinterested' (which means unbiased), but I believe you meant 'uninterested' (not interested). 

Overall, great work! "
1,"Language Families of the World Response
One part of Dr. McWorther’s lecture I found especially interesting was his
explanation of how language change is stagnated by literacy and printed literature. At
the 16:51 minute mark in Language Families of the World, Dr. McWorther discusses
how, historically, putting words to a page has cemented the way that a language has
been used, and having documented writing has restricted the organic nature in which a
language can evolve. While culturally and verbally, a language may change significantly,
these changes are not always reflected in literature because the manner in which things
have been written previously is considered the ‘correct’ way to use that language.
This phenomenon, while intriguing in its own right, prompted me to think about
how this manifests in other languages I am acquainted with, specifically American Sign
Language. In ASL, there is a written form called glossing, but from my understanding, it
is mostly an academic device, and does not have the same bearing on the signed version
of the language the way written English has on spoken English. While spoken English
may be held back by written English, ASL has easily and near-universally evolved as the
world around us has changed. To illustrate, the sign for phone, previously done with a
bulky cupped hand to mimic a corded or handheld phone, has transformed into a Y
handshape to symbolize a sleek smartphone. Almost all signers have casually
transitioned to this updated sign, signaling a subtle cultural change, one that would take
far longer to see the effects of in English, if ever achieved.
ASL can also evolve to meet the needs of a specific group of people, similar to the
way Black Country English evolved to meet the needs of the speakers, as noted at the
17:55 minute mark. Signs can be manufactured or changed for different environments,
based on what is most convenient. For example, in my home, the sign for ‘go’, instead of
a dual-finger pointing gesture, is done as a roll of both hands to make it easier for my
younger brother, who does not have the same fine motor control most signers would
have. ASL, which is not anchored down by formal writings, can freely change to meet
the needs of the many and the needs of the few, causing evolution to occur on a much
quicker timeline than spoken English.
",99,"
Hi Gray, you've beautifully grasped Dr. McWhorter's argument about literacy ""freezing"" language and applied it to a modality that he didn't even discuss. 

You introduced Black Country English as a supporting example in the final paragraph. While this is a valid reference, it is a dense concept to drop in at the very end without explanation. If you choose to introduce a new, specific linguistic variety like this, you might want to briefly summarize what it is in your own words to ensure your reader follows the comparison. "
1,"A topic I found to be intriguing in Dr. McWorther's video is the main question: ""Why Does Language Have to Change?"" During his lecture, he explains where languages come from and how they naturally change over time. He mentions that when groups split apart,  ""their versions of shared language begin to drift away from one another"" (Video 1 6':15""). He then goes on to say that as these groups remain separate, differences in pronunciation, meaning of words, and grammar form. Certain aspects are highlighted that interest change, including sound and word meaning. Because there are about 6,000-7,000 languages spoken around the world, we're likely to encounter a handful of multiple languages throughout our lives. Thus, people are exposed to several different ways sounds are produced and meaning expressed from diverse cultures, reinstating the concept that language change is natural and unavoidable. I found this topic interesting because of the idea that the current language we speak today will likely be very different in many years, and it intrigues me to imagine what it could sound like in the future. Additionally, encountering a diverse range of languages, especially within my university, has sparked my interest in learning about the similarities and shared phrases among them. Since my intended career path will most likely involve working with and treating people whose language I can't speak, I would need to be knowledgeable about how to communicate and interact with groups from different backgrounds. Such mirrors what I have already experienced at school or at work, where I've met people from diverse cultures and have asked them about their native language as a form of trying to better understand and connect with them. Overall, Dr. McWhorter's lecture opened my mind to the endless possibilities of language differences and aspects I should take note of if I ever try to fully learn a new language. Thus, being able to use this professionally, academically, and even socially, shapes how I'll interact with others in the future. ",96,"
Hi Golden, you correctly identified the core mechanism of language change. Your connection to your future career is also very relevant. However, for your next assignments, I'd like to see more specific examples. You mentioned encountering diverse languages at university and learning ""shared phrases."" Which languages have you encountered? What specific phrases did you compare? Grounding your reflection in concrete examples will make your writing much more persuasive. 

Additionally, be careful with spelling (e.g., professor's name) and word choice (e.g., ""...reinstating the concept"" may be more appropriate with the words, such as reinforcing or reaffirming)"
1,"he main point that Dr. McWorther made that I found really interesting is the way he
explains how distance and time are factors that gradually change a language, to the point that it
can eventually create a completely new language from the original. The way he explained it was
through a description of how the sounds that compose words in English, the example word he
used was “sock”, with time and distance, can gradually change, making a whole new word (at
Video 1, 7 min 35 seconds). He explains how the sounds the word “sock” makes are “s”, “ah”,
and “k”. He then goes on to explain how, over time and distance, every individual component of
the word can change, which would lead to the creation of a completely different word that
sounds nothing like the original word, “sock”. First, he explains how the “s” sound can first
change into a “sh” because of proximity to how close the sounds are, then he says how the “sh”
can change into a “zh” sound. He then goes to explain how, using the same idea of similarity
between sounds, the sound “ah” can gradually change into a “u” sound, and how the “k” sound
can change into “gh”. With the final result being a word that has the sound sequence of “zh-oo-
gh” which is completely different from the initial “s-ah-k”. The reason I’m interested in this is
that, since I speak Spanish, it explains the reason as to why there are a crazy number of word
similarities between all of the romance languages like Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Italian.
With a basic example I can think of being the word “Yo” in Spanish and the word “Je” in
French, which both mean the personal noun “I”. And so, as someone with an interest in learning
a second romance language like French, I find this language trait really interesting.",95,"Hi Sebastian, you did a good job detailing the specific sound shifts. Your step-by-step breakdown showed you really paid attention to the lecture. That said, the essay relies a bit heavily on summarizing the video, leaving less roomf or your personal reflection. For your next assignments, expand on why this interests you or provide more specific examples. Overall, good work! "
1,"There were numerous topics Dr. John McWhorter talked about in Language Families of
the World: Why Are There So Many Languages? That stood out to me as very interesting.
However, I think the topic I found the most intriguing was when he mentioned that even though
speakers of languages think that their language is staying the same it is actively changing. Near
the beginning of the film is when he mentions this idea while explaining that languages slowly
change and split into new ones over time just through sound changes (Video 1 8’:40”).
Dr. McWhorter makes it a point to claim that this is not incorrect but instead unavoidable
as it happens naturally. From generations to generations, simple sounds and pronunciations
slightly shift which in turn causes grammatical patterns to evolve. The meanings of words even
drift. When you monitor languages over time you can see that the small little changes that occur
start to accumulate to the point where original language speakers can no longer understand each
other with ease like they used to. This results in the formation of an entirely new language. In the
words of Dr. McWhorter languages are adapting to the ways humans use them in new contexts
but emphasized the point that no language is worsening.
Personally, I find this intriguing because my only fluent language is English. Growing up
I remember my grandparents and other elders always asking what different abbreviations meant
or asking me questions trying to figure out the new slang. Informal speech has become
increasingly prevalent with the increasing technology today and the constant use of texting or
being online. After Dr. McWhorter made his claim, it made me realize that the reason they didn’t
understand was because the language was evolving just as he claimed. Each generations slang
slowly became part of the English language to where those older didn’t understand what was
being said.
As you can see, the claims made by Dr. McWhorter changed my overall thinking. It made
me realize that differences are not incorrect and the English language, as well as all other
languages, was and is evolving right in front of my eyes. He also made me more aware of how I
speak and how the slang I use daily is becoming normal in language and isn’t necessarily slang. I
will now deeply ponder the idea of how one day when I’m older the English language will have
changed to where I no longer understand it without asking questions to understand the evolved
language.",99,"
Hi Lainey, this is a very thoughtful reflection. Your personal connection to your grandparents struggling with modern slang is an excellent example of generational language differences. For your future assignments, consider including specific examples from your own experience (e.g., what slang did your grandparents not understand?). Additionally, you wrote ""Each generations slang...."" This should be ""generation's slang."" "
1,"After viewing Dr. John McWhorter’s lecture from Why Are There So Many Languages?
Season 1, Episode 1, I have gathered a lot of insight into how easily a language can develop
into a completely new one over time. This goes against my own assumption that languages
remain relatively stable and instead shows how fluid communication actually is! It
especially fascinates me that the new language can sound so different from its
predecessor, that it becomes almost unrecognizable! It is also incredibly interesting to me
how majority of languages are only spoken, lacking a standardized writing system. Without
written records to preserve grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, these spoken
languages are free to quickly evolve. As generations pass, slight changes in pronunciation
or word usage come together, and eventually form new dialects and in some case entirely
new languages. An example provided by Dr. McWhorter really emphasizes this drastic
change (e.g., Why Are there so Many Languages? Season 1, Episode 1, 18 minutes 2
seconds). He discusses the development of “Black Country English,” which is a dialect that
emerged due to the isolation of certain communities during the Industrial Revolution in
England’s West Midlands. Because these populations were pretty much cut off and had
limited access to print and literacy, their speech patterns diverged very significantly from
Standardized English that is heard today. For instance, Dr. McWhorter explains how the
word “gave” transformed into the word “gid,” and “you can’t” has become “yow caw” in this
part of the world! The language was not “stuck on the page” and gradually transformed due
to new generations pronouncing sounds in a different manner without a reference to look
back upon.
I find this topic quite interesting since it helps explain differences in the way people speak
that I have noticed in my own life! While growing up, I have heard variations in
pronunciation, slang, and sentence structure depending on where someone is from or the
community they belong to, especially in Russia. My grandparents on my fathers side live in
Tatarstan, which is around eight hours by car from Moscow, but the difference in dialect as
well as language is drastic, nonetheless. Before watching this lecture, I did not think much
about why these differences existed, but Dr. McWhorter’s explanation really made me
realize that these variations happen a lot more than I could ever imagine!
",99,"
Hi Liliana, great job on this. You demonstrated a deep understanding of the material. Your personal connection is also an excellent example of the variation Dr. McWhorter describes. 

As this is a short essay, you don't need to include the full reference (e.g., Why Are There So Many Languages? Season 1, Episode 1) multiple times. A simple timestamp is enough. 

Also, try to use periods rather than exclamation points in academic writing."
1,"One topic Dr. John McWhorter discusses that I find especially intriguing is when and how
human language first began.
Time stamp: Video 1, approximately 3 minutes 24 seconds to 5 minutes 20 seconds.
What he says:
Dr. McWhorter explains that language likely developed when early humans began creating tools
and art, which suggests advanced thinking and communication. For a long time, scholars
believed language began around 40,000 years ago, based on cave art found in Europe. However,
he points out that modern humans (Homo sapiens) have existed for about 300,000 years, which
makes it unlikely that language suddenly appeared so late. He mentions discoveries of much
older art, such as cave art found in South America dating between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago,
suggesting that language may have existed much earlier. He also explains that there may have
been many early human groups with their own languages and forms of expression that we simply
have not discovered yet.
Why I find this interesting:
I find this topic fascinating because today there are about 6,000 languages in the world, with
countless dialects and accents, which shows how deeply language is tied to human history. Many
people focus on how languages are used today, but do not think about where they came from or
how long they have been developing. I would definitely love to study more about this, and also
from a biblical viewpoint, whether in school or as a hobby. I’m very interested in the bible as
well as linguistics, and I think we all need to look into language and culture since it all makes us
who we are as individuals. This discussion also reminds me of the biblical story of the Tower of
Babel in the Book of Genesis, where everyone originally spoke the same language until it was
divided, causing people to spread across the world. Whether viewed scientifically or religiously,
both ideas show how language plays a major role in shaping human societies and cultures.",97,"
Hi Taleiyah, your connection between the linguistic theory and the Biblical story is a fascinating comparison. However, for your future assignments, double-check factual information in your summary. You wrote that McWhorter mentions cave art in ""South America dating between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago."" Dr. McWhorter actually refers to South Africa (specifically Blombos Cave). "
1,"One topic that I found extremely intriguing is Dr. McWorther’s explanation on how
languages split over time due to gradual sound change, which eventually forms into new
languages and languages families. He explains that languages split over time because
small, unconscious changes in pronunciation gradually accumulate across generations.
Individual speakers are not aware that they are changing the languages, and as they
speak slightly different from the previous generation these changes might involve shifts
in vowel sounds, consonants being dropped, or sound merging together. He states that
when groups of speakers become geographically or socially separated, the sound
changes happen in different ways. Over time, as the groups are separated the
differences add up so that the speech varieties become mutually unintelligible, despite
originating from the same language. These differences go from simply being separate
dialects to being considered separate languages. Dr. McWhorter emphasizes that this
process is slow, natural, and inevitable, and it is one of the main reasons we have
distinct languages and languages families today. I find this interesting because I am
Ukrainian, which is a slavic language. I speak both Russian and Ukrainian so for me it is
quite easy to understand other slavic languages such as Czech and Polish. However,
when I went to Odesa, a city in Ukraine. They have a very unique dialect considering it
is influenced by yiddish, Russian and Ukrainian. Odesa is known for their humor and
idioms. This demonstrates that despite Odesa being a city in Ukraine where everyone
speaks Ukrainian their dialect is so different it almost makes it impossible for a native
Ukrainian speaker to understand. Their culture and historical influences have caused
the language spoken in Odessa to evolve differently from standard Ukrainian, showing
how social and geographic factors shape speech over time. Even though Odesa
speakers and standard Ukrainian speakers share the same linguistic roots, gradual
sound changes, borrowed vocabulary and distinct expressions have accumulated to
create a dialect that feels almost like a separate language. This directly reflects Dr.
McWhorter's point that language change is not sudden but rather the result of
communication shaped by other languages and separation between communities.",83,"
Hi Kseniya, this is a fascinating reflection. Your Odesa example perfectly illustrates Dr. McWhorter's point about how history and culture shape local dialects. 

However, there are several points you need to address for your next assignments: 

No timestamp: You discussed specific concepts from the lecture, but did not include a specific time. This is a requirement for the assignment.
Capitalization: You need to capitalize proper nouns and adjectives relating to languages or ethnicities. For example, it should be ""Slavic"" and ""Yiddish."" 
Spelling: You misspelled the professor's name as ""McWorther."" 
Sentence fragments: ""However, when I went to Odesa, a city in Ukraine."" This should be connected to the next sentence"
1,"In the film provided, Dr. McWorther talks about how the words merry, bra, and
pretzel can all be derived from the same word, which was a southern Ukrainian word (e.g.,
at video 1, 13 minutes 45 seconds). He explained that the Ukrainian word meant short, and
how over time, the word short could make people think of the word happy. Specifically, Dr.
McWorther says, “Well, if something is short, you might be glad that it was short.
Something like a party you didn't want to go to... And so, if it’s short... That might make you
happy. And over many generations that might mean your word for short ends up meaning
merry.”. Then he goes on to explain the same word and how it sounds like a ‘breck’ sound,
then to a ‘brach’ sound. “ Thats like brachial, like arm in Latin. What does that have to do
with [the word] short? Well, your upper arm is shorter than the other part of your arm, and
so you might in your language call that upper part your ‘shorty part’. Brassiere is shortened
to bra, which is up on your brachial.” then the last example he gives is the word pretzel,
saying, “its crossed arms! So that’s what pretzel traces back to. A pretzel is ‘armal’ and
that traces back to ‘shortyness’.” Merry, pretzel, and bra all started off as the same word
that nobody knew. I find this extremely interesting, the fact that one word can end up
having so many different meanings in all different languages, but also the fact that there
were languages that helped create all 7,000 different languages. The first time I heard
someone speaking Tagalog, I couldn't help but notice the major similarities between
Tagalog and Spanish. This was fascinating to me considering they are on opposite sides of
the world but does make sense since the Philippines were once occupied by the Spanish
empire.",90,"HI Kealani, your observation about Tagalog and Spanish is excellent. However, a significant portion of your essay consists of large block quotes from the lecture. In a short reflection like this, you should avoid quoting the professor at length. Instead, briefly summarize the concepts in your own words to demonstrate that you understand them. 

Doing this would have saved you a lot of space, which I would have preferred you use to provide more specific examples from your own experience. You started to do this with the Tagalog connection! I would have loved to read more about that or other personal linguistic observations. "
1,"Early on in the video, at about 1:10, Dr. McWorther mentions there are about 7000 languages in the world, or in his opinion closer to 6000. A lot of remaining video talked about specific sounds, how language evolved and how they differ, etc.. But honestly I had NO idea that there were that many languages in the world. I was thinking a few hundred max. This shocks me for a few reasons. One because of simply how they all differ in sound and style. For example, my girlfriend speaks French and Arabic. The two of these sound absolutely nothing like english. When something like Spanish has words such as 'escuela' that to a certain extent, mimic or sound like their counterpart in English (school). Meanwhile, listening to her speak in those languages sounds like straight made up sounds. Dr. McWorther said that there's a decent chance all these languages originated from one singular language. When he said that is when the number 7000 really blew my mind. Yes, it was over thousands of years, but nonetheless, that many? That's truly shocking. Slang and geography are both vital to these changes. People pronouncing words differently and/or making up their own, and then the next thing you know a generation is speaking their own form of language. People like my mother, who grew up in Guyana, were part of the Hindu religion but spoke English. However, it was broken english. Heavy slang, accents. pronouncing things completely different and a peculiar tone compared to someone in America. Another factor geographically is isolation. With a place like New Guinea, that is very isolated, that is believed to contain 800-900 languages within it's island. Which is crazy to think about, and it shows the impact isolation has had on people over the course of so many years.",92,"
Hi Luke, you've touched on some fantastic examples of linguistic diversity. Your personal connection to your mother's experience in Guyana is also valuable; what you described as ""broken English"" is likely Guyanese Creole, a fully developed language with its own grammar and history, not just ""broken"" speech. 

For your future assignments, please work on the flow and tone of your writing. While I do love the specific examples you shared, the transition between your points can feel a bit abrupt. Try to use transition words to connect your thoughts so the essay reads as one cohesive argument. Additionally, please adopt a more academic tone; phrases like ""straight made up sounds,"" ""cray to think about,"" and using all-caps for emphasis (""NO idea"") are a bit too conversational. Finally, don't forget to capitalize proper nouns. "
1,"Dr. McWorther brought many facts about the human language and interesting
examples. One important thing that he noted and I believe is essential as well is to
understand that of the many languages around the world, (7000 as Dr. McWorther said)
they all derived from one origin. He began to explain how languages can change and
start differentiating into new languages. One of the examples given was how the aw
vowel in raw fish has been developing more to be pronounced as rah fish ( time stamp
8:45). This was quite fascinating to me because as I heard Dr. McWhorter pronounced
those words, it made me realize the language’s sounds are shifting. He also provided
another example with the word caught.
As the sound slowly changes over time, so can the meaning of the words. At
around 14:00, Dr. McWhorter explained how the word short could have other meanings
such as merry or the upper arm. It is quite fascinating to see how humans take the
language and connect them to other meanings based on feeling which shows how
languages can expand. A real life experience I had with this was when I had spoken to
one of my friends from the United Kingdom. We spoke about how in America, hot can
mean the heat and feeling of the temperature, or describing something as attractive and
nice. In the United Kingdom, hot is sometimes used for the same aspect as well, but the
word cold also means the same. For example, “That car is cold!” Although this can be
considered slang, I think it also affects how the English language is spoken as the new
generations adapt and use these new meanings.
Something quite fascinating that I had not known about Dr. McWhorter brought
upon how the English language is being barricaded or held by writing. I did not know
that a language could develop and change more had it not been held by writing.
However, it is understandable how having people stick to something that is written down
as a staple could prevent the language from altering drastically.",98,"Great job on this, Maika! Your personal example of slang usage in the UK versus the US is a great observation of a semantic shift in real time. For your future assignments, be careful with spelling (You misspelled the professor's name as McWorther) and repetition (You used the phrase ""quite fascinating"" three times. Try to vary your vocabulary). "
1,"One topic Dr. John McWhorter discusses in 'Language Families of the World, Season 1, Episode 1' that I found especially interesting is the idea that sounds changing over long periods of time can later on develop into a new word used by the same or different language. (Time stamp: 7 minutes 25 seconds). In this part of the lecture, Dr. McWhorter explains that words are really just sequences of sounds, and over long periods of time, those sounds naturally shift as people speak more casually or slightly different. He uses the word ""sock"" as an example separately and clearly breaking it down into the sounds of  's' , 'ah' , and 'k'. According to McWhorter, a sound like 's' can slowly change depending on how it's pronounced. For example, it can soften into an 'sh' sound, similar to how someone might slur their words while tired or drunk. Over Generations that 'sh' sound can then shift even further into a 'zh' sound. These small pronunciation changes might seem unimportant in the moment, but over hundreds and thousands of years they can lead to words that sound completely different from the original. In McWhorter's example, the word ""sock"" might change from ""sock"", to ""shawk"" to ""zhoo"" and finally to ""jue"". 

I found this idea especially interesting because it shows how language change in unintentional and gradual, not something people plan or notice happening, it made me think about how often I change the way I pronounce words depending on who I'm talking to or how fast I'm speaking. For example, I might shorten words or pair sounds together without realizing it in everyday conversations, yet those tiny changes are exactly how languages evolve over time.

This concept also helped me understand how linguists are able to trace relationships between language families. Even when words look and sound very different today, recognizing sound changes makes it possible to see how languages are connected. Dr. McWhorter's explanation made language less fixed and more alive, shaped by every day speech happens everywhere and passed down across generations.",97,"Good job on this, Victor. You nicely summarized Dr. McWhorter's point on sound shift. For your next assignments, I'd like to see specific linguistic examples from your own experience. Additionally, please proofread for typos (e.g., ""language change in unintentiaonl), capitalization (e.g., Over Generations), and phrasing. "
1,"Dr. McWorther brought a variety of information of how languages change over time. His
explanation of how one language can turn into 7,000 languages was concise and punctual. In
further emphasize, words will slowly start sounding differently. On video 7 minutes and 39, he
used the example of the word “sock.” He demonstrated how the three sounds will naturally
change over time like a telephone game. Eventually throughout generations, a new language is
formed and it was not intentional, but all natural and unavoidable. Language families were
interesting to learn too. On video 1 19:43- 30:00, there are so many language families across the
world. For example, Indo- European, Altaic, and Click language are all language families and
they all have their own stories and experiences in forming tons of languages.
I found this fascinating because it explains why languages such as English, Italian, and
Spanish can be so different but yet so similar in the way they speak because they all fall in the
same language family, Indo-European family. In my personal life, my dad speaks Cantonese and
my mom speaks Tagalog. Both languages come from two different language families. Cantonese
is from Sino- Tibetan which is a branch of Chinese. Tagalog is from Austronesian language
family. Based on Dr. McWhorter explanation, these two languages do not come from the same
ancestor which is why thy do not sound anything alike. Not only sound, but in addition the
grammar and sentence structure are different. His explanation helped me understand how my
mom can speak Tagalog and how my dad can speak Cantonese and why it sounds so differently.
Both languages went through similar natural process because of small sound shifts over time that
eventually created their own distinct language. I believe whoever were civilized in Hong Kong
and Philippines helped influence its language too.
",93,"Hi Jayce, you did a great job applying the concept of language families to your own heritage; comparing your father's Cantonese to your mother's Tagalog was a perfect way to illustrate why some languages are distinct. 

However, there are some areas to improve. First, please proofread your writing for typos (e.g., McWorther -> McWhorter, thy -> they). Second, you described the lecture as ""punctual"" (which means ""on time""), but I believe you meant ""precise"" or ""poignant."" You also wrote ""in further emphasize"" but I believe you meant ""to emphasize further."" 

Overall, your personal connection to the material was excellent, demonstrating a clear understanding of the core concepts. "
1,"In season 1 episode 1 of Why Are There So Many Languages? Narrated by John
McWhorter, he discusses the many languages and language families of the world. He also
discusses the specific aspects that make up language and specifically those aspects that
differentiate languages from one another. McWhorter believes that all languages
descended from one language and eventually became 7,000 (Video 1, 1:28). There are
many reasons this is possible, but the one I particularly find the most fascinating is that
sound changes actually alter languages into new ones (Video 1, 8:05 to 11:25). McWhorter
explains that the sound changes are gradual and takes place over thousands of years
(Video 1, 10:20). To me, it's amazing how accidental sound changes in the way someone
pronounces a word can branch off into a whole other language! McWhorter describes that
breaking up a word like sock into s-ah-k can change from the –ah becoming –aw and –k
becoming –kh and even into –gh. McWhorter then goes on to explain that these sound
changes in the word sock can gradually turn the word into ‘zhoo’ and then ‘jue’ and
continues to explain that is exactly how new languages are created (Video 1, 10:30 to
11:18). I find this fact very intriguing because in middle school, I took Spanish 1 and 2 and
my teacher always stressed the fact that Spanish is very similar to English. I never really
understood what she meant by that and how they can be similar when they sound so
different, but with this fact that McWhorter explained, it makes so much sense to me now.
I’ve always wanted to learn more languages other than English and Spanish such as French
and Italian and I feel that with this new information I can apply it to when I learn a new
language and it will help me retain it better. I just find it so magnificent that 7,000
languages can stem from just one and over the course of many years through sound
evolution.",99,"
Hi Abigail, excellent job explaining Dr. McWhorter's sound shift and detailing the specific phonetic steps. Your connection to your Spanish class is also very relevant. 

For your next assignments, be careful with subject-verb agreement. "
1,"What I found interesting and impressive was the explanation of sound change at the 7-minute 36-second mark. Specifically, Dr. John McWhorter showed that the sounds in the word ""sock"" can change when people pronounce it differently. One sound can transform into another. The sounds of ""sock"" are 's', 'ah', and 'k'. All three of these sounds can naturally transform into other sounds over time. For example, 's' can become 'sh', and then 'sh' can become 'zh'. Through these sound changes, a single word can be pronounced differently, creating a new language. Furthermore, the meaning of a word in one language can change in another. The first reason I found this impressive and interesting is that I learned for the first time the real reason why there are so many languages ​​in the world.  I now understand that they all originated from a single language, but over thousand years, due to changes in pronunciation, they evolved into more than 7,000 different languages we have today. The second reason is that I realized many words in my native language, Vietnamese, have similar meanings and pronunciations to words in English, French, and Chinese. I learned that due to historical invasions of Vietnam by these countries, many words from these languages ​​were adopted and pronounced differently by Vietnamese people, thus becoming part of the Vietnamese language. For example, the Vietnamese word for ""safety"" is ""an toàn,"" which comes from the Chinese word ""安全 - ānquán,"" also meaning safety. The Chinese character ""quán"" was pronounced as ""toàn"" by Vietnamese people, giving rise to the word ""an toàn"" in Vietnamese. Another example is the word ""balcony"" in English, which is ""Balcon"" in French.  With a different pronunciation, it becomes ""Ban công"" in Vietnamese. Although the pronunciations differ, these three words in the three languages ​​essentially have the same meaning. I had known these things for a long time while I was still in Vietnam, but I never paid them any attention.  It wasn't until I learned how one language evolved into so many different languages ​​that I realized my own language also has many connections and similarities with other languages.",99,"
Hi Gia, this is a fascinating reflection! Your specific examples in Vietnamese were excellent illustrations of how pronunciation adapts when languages interact. That being said, I just wanted to make a small distinction for you to keep in mind: the ""sock"" example illustrates language change over time, while your Vietnamese examples illustrate language change due to contact. Both involve sound changes, but the mechanisms differ slightly. 

Overall, excellent use of personal knowledge in your assignment! "
1,"I found it very intriguing in the beginning of Dr McWorther film when he explains that language changes overtime and that even as you grow your own pronunciation of words starts to slowly ""drag"", in a sense, and you tend to pronounce words a little differently. I take this as me being 21 years old now I probably haven't noticed how differently I pronounce specific words or structure different phrases or sentences versus when I was just at the age of 15 years old, for example. In the film, (at Video 1, 7 minutes and 35 seconds) when Dr. McWorther begins to talk about ""sound change"" being the hardest to detect. He uses the example of the word ""sock"" and how overtime you may have your teeth change or even simply being drunk or what not and how that may interfere with the way you vocalize the word ""sock"" now. The example of being drunk may tend to drag the pronunciation of a word, going from pronouncing ""sock"" as ""S-ah-k"" versus being drunk you may drag your pronunciation to ""Zh-aww-k"". Even then, you could vocalize the word ""sock"" in many different varieties because there are just so many different ways others throughout the world vocalize different words. This really brings in the idea that language have formed in numerous ways throughout the decades and not only have they formed in vocal ways, but language can be written and expressed in art as well. This is only the surface level thinking of all this but is a great idea of what language might entail as a whole and understanding the linguistics of it all. So, throughout your life you will hear different languages around you, and you may be able to configure what might it be based on or even the similarities within each language. ",95,"Hi Aracely, you did a good job identifying the core concept of phonetic drift. 

However, your personal reflection needs more concrete examples. For example, what words do you pronounce differently than when you were 15 years old? Also, you have several run-on sentences and spelling errors. 

Expand on your personal reflection, and proofreading would strengthen your essay. "
1,"What I found most intriguing about the documentary episode is when Dr. McWorther mentions the limits placed on the evolution of language by literacy and classist assumptions (Video 1, 17:00). One specific thing he said that stuck with me was “If you have a page, you have the natural sense to say, ‘that is the correct language!’”. He then goes on to state that this leads to limitations on lingual expansions but also classist assumptions of “I speak my language better than you”. I specifically find this interesting because we’ve all had people correct us on our language, saying we’re speaking it wrong. I used to have a lisp, so I got that plenty after I got over my lisp, but it made me feel like I was worse at the language than I should be, when in actuality, it isn’t as important as people make it out to be. I also find this interesting because I’ve studied a lot of politics and classism and always had a light understanding of literacy being used as a barrier to entry for important class issues. For example, language and literacy were used throughout history to limit people's votes, such as the Three Estates in France or literacy tests in Jim Crow America. I think the connections between class and language are an interesting area of study, especially since literacy is often used by the rich to establish a level of dominance over poorer areas. The ideas presented in the video also backed this up, discussing the Black Country English dialect, in which there are many differences. The reason given for this is purely that the areas it developed in were slightly isolated and were poorer, and therefore didn’t have access to education and ‘proper’ literacy. I think that you can also see it in how racism predicates with the ideas of proper English, leading to people who may have separate dialects or not speak English as a first language being seen as improper or stupid. Overall, I just find the ideas of classism, politics, and language overlapping very interesting.",99,"
Hi David, you did a great job of connecting a linguistic concept to broader social contexts. Nicely done! 

Your specific references to Jim Crow literacy tests and the Three Estates in France are outstanding examples of how ""standard language"" is often used to disenfranchise specific groups. 

For your next assignments, pay more attention to spelling (e.g., you misspelled the professor's name as ""McWorther"") and phrasing (""... how racism predicates with the ideas..."" Here, you likely meant ""intersects with"" or ""is predicated on.""). "
1,"One topic that I found really interesting in the film Language Families of the World, in Episode 1 around 18 minutes and 12 seconds, is that the English language has many different dialects, such as the one shown in the picture. One of the dialects that I found most interesting was Black Country English. Dr. John McWhorter explains how many dialects formed the English language, and not only that, but also how the language is not uniform. Although some forms of English might be considered lost to time, many communities throughout the years adapted these dialects and formed them into the new English that we speak today.

The reason I find this interesting is because, although certain forms of the language are considered lost to time, many communities around the world can still use language that is very similar to the English we speak today and shape it to make it unique in their own way. Not only that, but I also find it intriguing how a language, in a very short span of history, can disappear as if it were nothing, and even though it evolved into a new English, parts of it were still left behind.

It also stood out to me how the English language keeps evolving yet remains relatively uniform after so many years of openness and creativity in many different aspects. Although many things may still seem lost to time, people continue to use them in everyday speech, and no language will truly die because there are no strict rules in a grammar book that define how to properly speak it. This topic relates to me because growing up, I always had to deal with mispronunciation of words and not being able to fully pronounce or express myself in the way the English language defines it. Even though I now have much more control of the language, there are still many words that are difficult for me to pronounce, or that I have blended with my native tongue to create new expressions. I am also able to use words from Colombia that are not heard in many other Latin American countries to express myself in the way I want to.",97,"Hi Daniel, this is a heartfelt reflection. It highlights the concept that ""non-standard"" speech isn't wrong; it's just a different branch. 

However, for your next assignments, I would love to hear specific examples from your reflection. Including the actual words makes the essay much more engaging and authentic. "
1,"The fact or topic that I find the most intriguing that Dr. McWorther brings up about languages and language families is that language is something that is naturally subject to change and proves such through the example of starting from just one language (Video 1, 6:10 – 6:21). Dr. McWorther discusses the origins of modern language and anthropological evidence supporting the idea that language evolves over time based on genetic diversity, distance, and other factors that influence how languages evolve.

This topic has also been introduced in my Language Matters class, as we talk about the origins of language and why it matters. After watching this film and the points that Dr. McWorther discusses, it allows me to have a better understanding of the origins of language and understand how to apply it in modern contexts. For example, since I am interested in graduating with a degree in Professional and Technical Communication, I can apply what I understand about languages into not just my writing in English but also understanding how these same concepts apply to other languages as well. It will also help me diver deeper into the concepts I will learn in my other courses when discussing aspects of language and rhetoric in my speech and writing, allowing me to tailor my own work to a wider audience than I would have been able to previously.

In addition to my intended career field, this concept also ties into my future endeavors in learning other languages, such as Spanish, and getting a deeper understanding on how language shapes cultures, or vice versa. I can apply this knowledge in my dealings with others not just from the standpoint of language, but also in understanding more about the people themselves too. Through this deeper understanding, I can explore diverse cultures and gain a greater understanding of the world around me and the people in it.",90,"
Hi Kalie, good job connecting the concept of language evolution to your major in Professional and Technical Communication. 

However, to strengthen your future arguments, I'd like to see more specific examples from the video (such as Dr. McWhorter's breakdown of sound shifts) rather than just a general summary. The same goes for your personal reflection. What specific concepts will you apply to your future career? How will you use this concept in learning languages? Lastly, please proofread for small typos—you wrote 'diver deeper' instead of 'dive deeper.' 

Overall, good work! "
1,"I found it intriguing when he was demonstrating how easy it is for the sounds and pronounciations of words to change (starting at 7:44). He was saying how something as simple as an older person not being able to pronounce a word correctly could change the way an entire generation of people pronounce something. Over time as people migrate to new locations and continue to repopulate, languages get mixed around and passed down from generation to generation. Due to this phenonmenon , the human species has over 7,000 languages. Some of these languages are more simliar than others, making up language families. However, most languages all have words for the same things, even though the words may be completley different in spelling and pronounciation. He also talks about how slang changes languages quickly as well, and is helping us constantly develop new words that spread rapidly. It is interesting how we just adapt to what we hear and how over time two completely different words could mean the same thing based on the changed pronounciation of a couple of letters. This relates to the modern world when you think about things like accents and different words for things in different regions. People from different countries may pronounce thingd differently but also can have complelety different words for the same thing. This makes me think about the more southern people I've met in my life that do things like calls shopping carts ""buggies"" or the way my Dad who was raised in Pennsylvania says ""beg-el"" instead of ""bay-gel"" when saying bagel. The language may not seem like it changes that much in your country alone but every region changes a couple words and pronounciations. It makes you wonder what our language will look like 50 years from now, with the everchanging slang we hear everyday. ",95,"
Hi Erin, you've done a great job connecting the lecture concepts to your own family. The example of your dad's Pennsylvania accent is a perfect illustration of regional variation. 

However, for your next assignments, please proofread your writing before submission. Specifically, watch for spelling errors (e.g., ""pronounciations,"" ""thingd""), capitalization (e.g., ""Dad,"" ""southern""), and grammar (e.g., ""people....calls shopping cart.""). "
1,"In this first episode of Language Families of the world, around 12:30, Dr. McWorther talks about how small parts of languages can change in many ways over time and can lose their original meaning. He uses an example of the word ""only,"" which really stood out to me. He explains that ""only"" originally came from two separate words, which are ""one"" and ""like"". Over the years, these words blended together so well that nowadays we don't think of these little words as multiple parts. Dr. McWorther uses this example to show that many word endings in English, like ""-ly"", started as words but later on became add-ons rather than actual words alone. He mentions that language is always changing in ways people notice non-consciously. 

   I find this topic interesting because it made me realize how much history can be found even in the simplest of words. Before watching this film, I never thought about where the real meanings behind words like ""only"", ""really,"" or ""slowly"" came from. Now that I've watched the lecture, I see that the words we use every day have a deeper meaning due to how language has evolved over many years. This also makes me stop and think before I use these words as I talk to others. 

   I can relate this idea to my own life because I grew up speaking two languages: English and Arabic. Depending on who I'm with, I switch how I speak in both languages. In English, I talk casually with my friends and more formally with teachers. This can affect the tone I use. After understanding this lecture, I noticed that the small punctuation and word choice differences I make in Arabic could also affect language change, just like in English. For example, some words that my generation tends to use these days are very different from how my parents used to say them, which shows that Arabic is changing, as well as many other languages, even if we don't always notice it. 

   Another way I can relate to this is by texting in messages. I often shorten words and make abbreviations like ""really"" to ""rlly"" or ""Because"" to ""cuz,"" even though these words are already short and don't need to be abbreviated in the first place. I never saw this as important before, but now I understand it as another form of language change. Just like how the word ""only"" evolved from two words into one, texting could also be shaping what our future English looks like. 

   Overall, Dr. McWorther's explanation helped me understand that language change happens slowly and naturally over time, happening in both the English and Arabic I speak every day. It also made me realize that language change doesn't happen in just one part of the world; it happens everywhere. ",97,"
Hi Sarah, this is a very insightful essay. You made a brilliant connection between the historical evolution of the word ""only"" and your own modern habit of shortening ""because"" to ""cuz"" in text messages. Your connection to Arabic is also strong. 

For your future assignments, please try to keep your essay within the 300-400-word range. Also, please proofread carefully: you misspelled the professor's name as ""McWorther,"" and you used the word ""punctuation"" when you meant ""pronunciation"" in your paragraph about Arabic. "
1,"One moment I found intriguing was around the 18-minute mark, when Dr. McWhorter starts talking about Black Country English. At first, the name “Black Country” sounds like it would be an American dialect, but Dr. McWhorter explains that it’s actually a dialect from a region in England, and then he says it sounds more like Norwegian, which threw me off more. He says it sounds that way because the dialect kept older parts of English that most other places let go of over time. The languages changed frequently because different regions held onto different pieces of the language, so because of that, even though the name Black Country sounds like it could be American, the way people speak there is more like listening to an older version of English, which then ends up sounding more Norwegian than English. I found this really interesting because I always thought English accents fit into a few basic groups, so hearing that an English dialect can sound like a completely different language made me realize how unique the history behind language is. For example, the first time I heard certain Caribbean accents, some of the words and rhythms felt familiar even though I could not explain why, which gave me the same feeling that language holds pieces of the past, even when we are not aware of it. This moment stayed with me because it showed me that language is more than just how people talk. It comes from years of people moving, meeting, and mixing their ways of speaking. Since I pay close attention to how people talk, especially across different cultures, it made me realize how much history is hidden in the accents we hear every day and helped me see that there is a lot more behind the way someone speaks than is actually noticed, so overall, this part helped me understand how much depth there is in language and why certain accents sound the way they do.",96,"Hi Mya, you clearly grasped one of the main concepts of the lecture. Your personal reflection to Carribean accents is also very relevant. 

For your future assignments, please focus on the following areas: 

Timestamps: Be more specific with your citations. You wrote ""around the 18-minute mark,"" but Dr. McWhorter introduces Black Country English specifically at 18:04.
Run-on sentences: Your final sentence is a run-on. You string together multiple clauses. Try to break these into shorter sentences. 
Specific examples: You mentioned Caribbean accents felt ""familiar,"" but you didn't explain how. Which specific words or rhythms stood out? Adding concrete examples would have elevated this essay. "
1,"I enjoyed Dr. McWorther’s lecture. He seemed very passionate about the material,
and I found his lesson engaging. What I found the most fascinating about this film was how
languages evolved over time. Especially how English was affected.
Dr. McWorther’s description of Black Country English made me curious. I learned
how foreign it sounded when he explained patterns like “I gave” being “I gid” or “I don’t”
being “I day” (Language Families,18:30). I liked how English, being so established and well
known, still had the capacity to become something else entirely. It made me wonder if
English could change that drastically in the future.
I realized that this could be difficult when Dr. McWorther mentioned how literature
held back the evolution of our language (Language Families, 19:14). I find it rather sad that
English stayed in its limitations, but I acknowledge that consistency could help with
comprehending historical records. Though I wonder that if English did change like Black
Country English, would people have been able to witness language change during their
lifetime? There have still been instances such as when Dr. Mcworther mentioned how
“slowlike” became “slowly” because it was spoken so fast (Language Families, 11:45).
While this is not as drastic it can demonstrate how some instances can slip past the
literacy constraints.
I find this interesting because it used real world examples to demonstrate how
languages can branch out like that. This also reminds me of what a teacher’s assistant in
my Spanish class told us. She is more informed about this change than I am, but in her
country of Spain, certain words pronounced with a V are now subtly sounding more like a
B. It was fascinating to me that she got to see language change before her own eyes. While
I do not notice this change in our own language, we usually come up with slang that
sometimes becomes relevant in our dictionary, even if it is not formal. While our words do
not have completely different meanings, we do not speak exactly like how Americans did
one hundred years ago. I still find that quite intriguing",96,"Hi Lyon, this is a thoughtful essay. You successfully identified the tension between oral evolution and the stabilizing force of literacy. Your connection to your Spanish TA's observation about the ""V"" vs. ""B"" sound change is excellent. 

For your future assignments, please pay closer attention to the spelling of the professor's name. Additionally, try to be more precise with your sentence structure. ""Though I wonder that..."" sentence is a bit tangled. "
1,"One aspect of Language Families of the World that caught my attention was from Dr.
McWhorter as he talked about how languages can change and adapt themselves and become
wholly different tongues-from the primary source to learn that something really is possible
around here, 1:33. Here in this film, Dr. McWhorter explains how Latin eventually matured into
the Romance languages: Spanish, French, Italian. The changes and movements which give rise
to language are processes naturally occurring with the mobility by which people become
exposed to new groups and environments, adding to the effects produced by changes which
gradually build up.
I found this quite interesting because language is not a static thing but something that
continuously evolves as humans use it. Despite the two languages being derived from the same
roots in Latin, one can now appreciate how far apart they are in sounds as well as grammar and
vocabulary constructions-the main difference. This made me realize that there is much influence
on communication due to history and culture.
This is related to me as well as I know Vietnamese and English and in the process of learning
Chinese. I sometimes come across words or sounds which tend to be similar among languages,
especially in Chinese and Vietnamese because they share some common historical influences.
Even English being a Germanic language has borrowed some terms and words from the
Latin-based languages. Take for example, a lot of words such as ""information"" and ""culture""
belong to the Latin family but are used in daily English lexicon.
Dr. McWhorter's explanation has stretched my mind to see how language families are
understood more in terms of human history than in terms of grammar or vocabulary. As people
move around, they start trading and amalgamating new communities which eventually grow
their languages together with their movements. Hence language is a reflection of the changes
societies undergo over time.
Overall, the introduction brings you to the changes and evolution languages experience as they
come from common ancestors. It also opened up a much wider horizon on the myriad
languages in the world and piqued my curiosity about how the different languages I speak fit into
this bigger picture.",96,"
Hi Hailey, great job on this. I particulalry enjoyed your observation about the similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese, and it also demonstrates a clear understanding of how language contact works globally. 

For your future assignments, please work on smoothing out your sentence structure. Your first sentence is a bit confusing and difficult to parse. Also, be careful with word choice; ""amalgamating new communities"" might be better with ""integrating with"" or ""merging with."" "
1,"In his video, ""Language Families of the World,"" Dr. John McWhorter speaks
about how languages change and settle into families. Of all the things actually
mentioned in Dr. McWhorter's talk, the sound change, which is a gradual change
of articulation over generations during the transferring generations of languages,
was not actually surprising to me, but very interesting. It has touched my life
because it only makes evidence that language changes are not made by people, but
about him or herself.
He discusses the sound changing in Episode 1, 7 minutes, 36 seconds, using
simple examples on how little modifications in pronunciation can build up. What is
emphasized is that speakers do not notice the fact that they are changing the
pronunciation of a sound, so from this accumulation of small phenomena under
longer spans of time, great contrasts among closely related languages may arise.
Sound change takes place evenly and predictably, usually without the knowledge
of those using the language. Failure to notice the tiny shifts over several
generations leads to languages, initially very similar, sounding increasingly
disparate. This is what Dr. McWhorter attempts to prove as to how linguists are
left with a clue justifying the similarities, and at the same time, different sound
changes found to be in languages of common descent.
Sound change is interesting to me because the same phenomenon has been
observed in my experience of learning other languages. For example, in English,
there is a discrepancy between the spelling and pronunciation of a word; a word
with the same spelling can have different sounds according to several accents. In
other words, a more practical way of seeing sound change is found in accents such
as that of the British and American which put an obvious difference in the
pronunciation of the same word. Common accents are a barrier when it comes to
streamlining sound changes for more international students like me, during the
initial adjustment to the language. In learning a language having various accents,
sometimes the variation in sounds may prove difficult to comprehend, especially
when one is familiar with one accent, but not the other. It gives an explanation on
how to hypothesize why that is so, as well as why it's sometimes hard in
pronunciation when it's a familiar language, but this is how people know it.
In general, Dr. McWhorter's discussion on sound change helped me not to see
language as a fixed system but rather as something evolving. Sound change plays
an important part in determining language family formation and explains the
gradual processes whereby languages diverge from one another. Having learned
about this process, I have a richer sense of appreciation for both language
development and the continual flux that characterizes human communication on a
generational basis.",97,"Hi Pham, you've correctly identified one of the most important concepts in the course. Your personal connection as an international student is valuable here. 

However, your essay would benefit from a proofread for clarity. There are several sentences where the phrasing becomes confusing. For example, The sentence ""It has touched my llife because it only makes evidence that langauge changes are not made by people, but about him or herself."" seems you are trying to say that language change is an internal/subconscious process, but the wording obscures the point.  "
1,"Throughout watching the "" Language Families of the world"", there was one point in the film that stood out to me, that had me questioning things. This was the fact that there are around 7000 languages (6000 accoording to  Dr.McWorther, yet there is still a thought that languages originated from one place and changed over time. This comes up pretty early in the film, around the fifty second mark. He tells us that there are 7000 lagnuages but he thinks that there are only 6000. This part alone is already mind blowing for me, because there are only 195 countries in the world. This is incredible to think about because the amount of languages versus contries ratio is nearly thirty nine times. This is just so intresting becuase it is normal for countries to be broken up my regions and have some different languages but this many is incredible. On top of this, for languages to all come from one place on earth and then change over time because of different sounds had me thinking. I understant that when Dr. McWorther gave the examples using sounds, like ""sh"" and ""s"" how the sounds can change and that language is changeable. I don't understand how a language could change this much however, since that would mean there would've had to have been so many different variations of sounds. An example of my life where I have seen this is just in my family. I have relatives from memphis versus relatives from florida. The pronounciation of certain words like ""earrings"" is clearly different, but I can't see how it is enough to make a whole new language, yet alone 7000. Even looking at countries today like america only has a certain amount of languages spoken. I can understnad that humans have broken up and isolated from each other into their own groups but this amount is quite impressive to learn about. This relates to something I am really intrested in because I really like to learn about the human brain. I would love to learn more about how often new langauges are being made. I learned that there is a langauge dying every few minutes, but how common is it for a new one to be made.",93,"
Hi Ryna, you have raised a fascinating mathematical point: the massive discrepancy between the number of countries and the number of languages! 

I also enjoyed your personal reflection regarding your family's Memphis vs. Florida accents. 

For your future assignments, I want you to prioritize proofreading. This essay has numerous basic errors, including punctuation and spelling mistakes. "
1,"One fact that Dr. McWhorter made at the opening of the video is what I found the most interesting, that being ""how many languages there are in this world"" (McWhorter, 2019, 0:44). He shares that there are 7,000 languages in the world, though he believes the number is closer to 6,000. Based on what he describes as ""lumpers and splitters"", the difference seems to depend on how professionals in the field list languages. For instance, some may split a language family into multiple languages, or instead lump them all together. An example of this showed up later in the video when talking about the Click languages in the African language family and how they are three families, not just one (McWhorter, 2019, 22:30). I found this fact about the number of languages in the world quite interesting for a few reasons.

For one, I simply had no idea there was that many. Growing up I obviously learned that there are billions of people in the world, with hundreds of countries and accompanying languages, but the actual number of languages was much higher than I believed. It's something I had not learned about or researched before. As I learn more about linguistics, for example through prior courses such as Human Geography and language classes like Modern Japanese, it makes more sense to me how and why there are so many languages. History, cultures, and geographic environments are all factors in the creation and progression of languages, as well as the loss of languages.

My main goal has been to learn Japanese and traveling there. I began learning Japanese language last year, and that alone has been a very difficult and time consuming task. Knowing that thousands of languages exist puts things into perspective and makes me appreciate the fact that I'm trying to learn one, on top of already knowing English and Spanish.

While it is possible to research and learn about most of the languages out there, I find it fascinating that even the best language learners probably cannot learn anywhere near all the languages. There are simply too many.",99,"Hi Nelson, this is a great essay that demonstrates a clear understanding of the ""lumpers vs. splitters"" debate in linguistics. Your personal connection to your studies in Human Geography and Modern Japanese adds valuable context, and the struggle you feel when learning Japanese is a perfect example of why those 6,000+ languages are so distinct! 

For your future assignments, try to pay attention to your sentence structure. Some sentences were a bit wordy; sometimes it is more effective to be direct or to break them into shorter sentences. Additionally, while your citations were formatted well, since this is a short essay, you can simply refer to the video timestamp without the full ""(McWhorter, 2019)."""
1,"One topic that Dr. McWhorter discusses in Language Families of the World that I found especially intriguing is the idea that languages are constantly changing and diverging, even when speakers are not consciously trying to change them. This point comes up when Dr. McWhorter explains how languages within the same family gradually become distinct over time, eventually becoming mutually unintelligible. This discussion appears around Video 1, 12:30, when he explains how Latin slowly evolved into the Romance languages.

At this point in the film, Dr. McWhorter explains that languages do not suddenly split or change due to a single event. Instead, small pronunciation shifts, vocabulary changes, and grammatical differences accumulate across generations. Over time, these gradual changes result in entirely new languages, such as Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, all of which descended from Latin. What stood out to me is his emphasis that language change is natural and unavoidable, not a sign that a language is “decaying” or becoming worse.

I find this idea interesting because many people, including myself at times, tend to think of language change as something negative or incorrect, especially when it comes to slang or informal speech. However, Dr. McWhorter’s explanation helped me realize that what we often label as “bad grammar” may simply be language in transition. For example, I have noticed differences between how older family members speak English compared to how people my age communicate, especially through texting and social media. Abbreviations, new slang, and altered sentence structures are common, and while they might seem improper to some, they reflect the same gradual processes Dr. McWhorter describes.

This concept also connects to my academic interests because it shows how language is deeply tied to culture, history, and human interaction. Understanding that languages naturally evolve makes it easier to appreciate linguistic diversity rather than judge it. Dr. McWhorter’s discussion helped me see languages not as fixed systems with rigid rules, but as living tools that adapt to the needs of their speakers over time.",98,"Great job on this, Luke! You beautifully articulated the connection between the historical evolution of Latin and modern perceptions of ""bad grammar."" It also connects to the concepts of prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar :) 

My only minor suggestion for next time is to include specific examples of your experiences. For example, you can add a specific phrase you use that your older family members don't. 

Overall, nicely done! "
1,"I found the way that Dr. John McWhorter explained how languages and words can
change over time to be particularly interesting. Dr. McWhorter discusses this topic from
(00:07:19) to (00:11:18) in the film episode provided. In this segment of the episode, Dr.
McWhorter talks about how generations of speakers pronounce sounds differently from the last
generation, which, as he puts it, effectively evolves words and phrases like a game of telephone.
Additionally, Dr. McWhorter uses the similarities in sounds in English and uses the word “sock”
to come up with an example of how sounds eventually blend or change into one another over
time to create new words or meanings, and arrives at a new word, “jue,” as an alternative for
“sock.”
I find this interesting because of the real-world comparisons this has. In the episode, Dr.
McWhorter compares this change from sock to ‘jue,’ but also from “raw fish” to the sound “rah
fish,” similar to “caught” versus “cot.” I had not thought of language change as subtle changes to
individual sounds before watching this film, and reflecting on this has allowed me to open my
mind and ears to hearing these differences. This shift has led me to experiment with and become
more familiar and aware of the way I pronounce words and sounds. Another interesting aspect of
this, to me, is that my speech and pronunciation have been influenced by my friends, family, and
even social media, which introduces a new layer of the fluidity of speech and language.
For example, my dad is from New Jersey and has a slight accent that emphasizes the
“aw” sound in words when he speaks. This means that words like ball, or even coffee, sound
more like “bowl” and “coorfee.” While I do not pronounce words with the same accent, this has
affected the way I pronounce the “ah” sound in “water.” Thus, while all language is tangible and
interactive, understanding the subtle changes that lead to language evolution adds a new layer of
depth to the ways people interact and share conversation, as well as to how the mimicry of other
accents and dialects acts as a constant way to engage with the ever-changing landscape of
language and speech.",99,"Hi Isabella, this is a fantastic reflection. You demonstrated a clear understanding of sound shift through a summary of the lecture and connected it to your own examples. Your dad's New Jersey accent was very relevant! 

For your future assignments, be careful with your word choice; you described language as ""tangible"" (able to be touched), but language is generally considered auditory or abstract unless you are referring specifically to written text. Also, try to break up your sentences; your final sentence was over 50 words long, which can make it hard to follow. "
1,"The part of the video that I started to find interesting was when he introduced “Sound
Change” (video at 7 min, 37 Seconds). He then introduced a simple word “Sock” and
demonstrated how it is made up with three different sound segments S-Ah-K, and how
these sounds can vary over time and change depending on where you are from, your age,
subsistence influence, and while he never mentioned this, I found that It should be added,
but social norm of how people speech, a new type of speech to support this is Vally Girl due
to it being the newest form of accent that many people on the west coast of the united
states have developed.
Going back to the word Sock (S-Ah-K) he gives the example of how the S is closely related to
the Z sound, and the Ah vowel could change to Oo as this is found in British Accents,
example: Call. Americans say K-A-Ll while British would say K-oow-L, closely related to
“Cool”. Lastly he mentioned K, and how it became closer to Ch, Kh, and eventually Gh. This
would example shows how if there was one single language over 300,000 years ago, due to
migration and the development of accents would cause those words to change over time.
For personal experience, I have seen this while learning Spanish and talking to my wife.
Whenever she says something that I don’t understand, she would say “Ok, well word
associate” meaning which word in English sounds closely to what I said in Spanish. Example,
Teléfono sounds closely related to… Telephone to include Cellular and Cellphone. I felt
compelled and believed everything Dr. McWorther said because of my personal experience
learning new languages. However, I am curious about how they could relate to languages in
words and sounds in languages that are not where close to where the “one language”
originated from (believed to be Africa). Example islanders of the indo-pacific, or the native
American tribes throughout all of north and south America.",90,"Hi Daxton, you brought up an excellent modern example of sound change by mentioning the ""Valley Girl"" accent. Your observation about Spanish-English cognates is also very relevant. 

Regarding your final question about how distant languages relate to an African origin, the answer lies in human migration. Dr. McWhorter describes this later in this lecture. 

For your future assignments, please pay much closer attention to your spelling and capitalization errors. You should capitalize proper nouns. You also had some confusing phrasing, such as ""not where close"" (you likely meant ""nowhere close"") and ""social norm of how people speech"" (should be ""speak"")."
1,"One topic that I found especially intriguing about language appears in the film, Language
Families of the World. “Why Are there so Many Languages?”, (10 minutes and 20 seconds
in.), when Dr. John McWhorter mentions that smaller groups separating for long periods of
time causes linguistic diversity. This concept is vital because it proves how language
changes can happen naturally through many generations.
Over time, tiny alterations can occur in pronunciation and grammar. Things as simple as
sound changes in words cause languages to turn into other languages. When people get
separated from each other for a long time, they often start changing sounds. Someone may
pronounce caramel as “car-mel” or “car-uh-mel"". When this happens, it leads to the
creation of new words and linguistic diversity. As these small changes in words occur, they
will eventually cause a whole new language to form.
I found this fact interesting in the film because working with kids daily, I have seen how
they use and say words differently than us adults. How we may portray and pronounce a
word can be slightly different to a kid and mean something slightly different as well. I see
every day how the younger generation twists words and repeats them differently. This
reflects Dr. McWhorter's point that small language alterations can grow into something
bigger over time. It shows that language changes are not sudden. This fact has made me
more aware of the reality that through each generation, words are constantly being
reshaped with new definitions. In all, Dr. John McWhorter's point helped me learn and
appreciate how language change is continuous and subtle.",91,"
Hi Haley, you have correctly identified how separation leads to sound changes. Your observation about working with children is also quite insightful. For your future assignments, ensure you meet the 300-word minimum. You could have easily expanded this by giving specific examples of the words the children ""twist."" Detailed examples not only prove you understand the concept but also help you hit the length requirement :) "
1,"One topic I found intriguing comes up around 7:42, when Dr. McWorther discusses how sounds in words like ""sock"" change slightly from generation to generation. Over time, these small shifts can transform the way words are pronounced, as well as their meanings. He explains earlier, around 7:20, that each generation pronounces sounds a little differently, and after enough time, the transformation can be quite dramatic. I find this fascinating because I notice it in my own speech. For example, having grown up in New York City, Philadelphia, and New England, I often drop the ""r"" in words like ""park"" and ""car,"" saying ""pahk the cah,"" and I elongate vowels in words like ""coffee"" (cawfee) and ""water"" (wooder). Those around me who grew up in Florida, however, pronounce these words with clearer ""r"" sounds and shorter vowels. This demonstrates how regional influences shape pronunciation and how small differences reflect larger patterns in language evolution.

These differences make me wonder why English in America doesn't seem to be changing more rapidly, even though people from different regions pronounce words differently. Are these differences considered dialects, and if not, when would they become recognized as such? Dr. McWorther also discusses around 17:50 how literacy acts like a ""stick in the wheel,"" slowing the natural evolution of language. If that is true, is it even possible for American English to change significantly? I also wonder how modern factors like the internet and ease of travel affect this. When scrolling through Instagram reels or TikTok, we are constantly exposed to different accents of English - will this eventually cause accents to merge into a more uniform, ""standard,"" American accent? Similarly, exposure to television and movies could both preserve certain pronunciations while also encouraging new changes, meaning language change may not stop entirely, it may just take different forms. 

It is also interesting to compare this to other countries. During westward expansion, people traveled across America extensively, yet we do not see nearly as many English dialects/languages here as China has in its language. Dr. McWorther mentions around 9:18 how even certain English sounds, like the ""aw"" sound, are disappearing over time, which makes me wonder if the standardization of English in the U.S. is connected to education, media, and migration patterns. This raises questions about how social, cultural, and technological factors influence whether a language diversifies into many dialects or remains more uniform. ",99,"Hi Madison, this is an outstanding reflection that combines personal experience with high-level linguistic questioning. The specific examples of your own accent features are fantastic, too. 

Regarding your comparison between the US and China: Chinese civilization has had thousands of years for the language to fracture, whereas English speakers have only been spreading across North America for about 400 years. 

For your future assignments, please pay close attention to the spelling of the professor's name (it is McWhorter, not McWorther). "
1,"What I have picked out to be the most interesting or memorable part of Dr.McWorther’s film on world languages would be the existence (and more specifically survival) of Basque in East Europe. While speaking on the existence of different language families in the different continents, Dr.McWorther circles back to Europe to highlight the isolate language of Basque (23:00), that being a language that is the last of a now extinct language family. Basque would then be the linguistic equivalent to an ‘endling’, that being the last animal of a species before extinction. I find it’s survival in regards to greater European history, as with the prevalence of conquest from empires such as Rome, or the prevalence of contact language that was discussed at length in lecture and the readings. I can also draw upon personal experiences of being the last of a group, like how I find myself being the last one still interested in a topic,movie,show or game long after my other friends have moved on from it.",73,"
Hi Joziah, you introduced a beautiful metaphor by calling the Basque language a ""linguistic endling."" However, you have made a geographical error: Basque is located in Western Europe. 

For your future assignments, you must ensure you meet the 300-400 word requirement. Your current essay is far too short to fully develop your ideas. A perfect place to expand would have been your personal experience, which felt a bit abstract. You mentioned staying interested in a game or movie after friends move on. But which game? Why did you stay interested? How did you resist the trend to move on? Just as Basque resisted the pressure of Roman conquest, explaining your own specific resistance to social pressure would have made for a compelling comparison. Also, please watch out for sentence fragments and spelling. "
1,"A topic that immediately caught my attention in the film lecture was the statement made by Dr Whorter stating that all 7000 languages originated from one single language. (3:00-3:15).  The main reasons I find this interesting is due to how extraordinary the number of 7000 is when making the assumption they all started from 1. As a Christian my argument to this statement is the story of the Tower of Babel as told in the bible (Genesis 11:1-9). The story about the Tower of Babel teaches that there were may different people in one area who were building a tower in vain of God so God punished them with confusion of language and no one could understand each other. I believe the chances of this are much higher and make more sense then saying 1 language turned into 7000, but then as a Christian I also believe billions of humans came from only two in the beginning. Either way they are both very interesting aspects and I greatly enjoyed the film lecture video. I also question if un contacted tribes have their own language and how they would have developed that. I have also heard an interesting theory on if everyone has their own voice within their head aswell. I wonder this especially in deaf people who have never heard a word. I have always had a fascination with the idea of being deaf or mute because of how often  the ability to speak and hear are taken for granted. I would love to learn sign language one day and be fluent in it but at the moment I find no reason to, but as this class continues maybe I’ll find a reason too or atleast another language besides English. Overall I value all languages equal and think they have fascinating origins with even more interesting cultural ties. Some of my goals in life are to travel the world and learn more about other cultures and languages on the way. ",94,"Hi Alexander, it is a thoughtful reflection on how linguistic theories intersect with your beliefs. 

For your future assignments, please focus on staying on topic and proofreading. The second half of your essay goes a bit off tangent (discussing travel goals and learning ASL) rather than analyzing Dr. McWhorter's arguments. It is okay to bring two topics in one essay, but in that case, you need to make sure these topics flow smoothly. Also, there were several mechanical errors: you wrote ""may"" instead of ""many,"" confused ""then"" with ""than,"" and ""too"" with ""to."" You also need a space between ""as"" and ""well."" "
1,"Intriguing topic that was brought up by Dr. John McWhorter in Language Families of the World is the insight that languages are constantly changing and splitting over time due to natural sound change, even if it is happening unconsciously (Video 1 10’:25’’). There, he explains that the change in language is hard to avoid because even small pronunciation shifts over time can make the word sound totally different which can lead to creation of various languages.

Dr. McWhorter makes it sure that language change is not something that gets impacted by laziness or mistakes, more so because of natural human speech patterns. People subtly alter sounds over time, and later when they’re separated geographically or socially, these changes move in different directions. So this process leads new languages to form within the same language family. This idea gives kind of explanation of why there are so many languages nowadays and how languages like Spanish, French and Italian still have similarities but mutually unintelligible. This topic got my interest especially because it’s against the view that some languages are “correct” while others are not. Personally, after moving to US for my studies, i noticed how different age groups and regions pronounce some words in English differently even though both speak the same language. Some words like “literally” or “like” are used differently today than they did few decades ago, which is the reflection of Dr. McWhorter describes as semantic and sound change.

All this together also impacts my interest in communication and interaction with people. Perception of language change being a natural thing makes me more aware of how language reflects culture, time period, and identity. Instead of seeing differences in languages as 'wrong', Dr. McWhorter's explanation gets us to see them as language being a living thing that develops over the time depending on human behavior. ",97,"
Hi Dinara, you've done a great job identifying one of the most important takeaways from this course: language change is not a sign of ""laziness"" but a natural, biological process. Your observation about how ""literally"" and ""like"" have changed is an excellent example as well. 

For your future assignments, be careful with capitalization. The pronoun ""I"" must always capitalized. You also tend to drop articles, wriitng ""moving to US"" instead of ""the US"" and ""gives kind of explanation"" instead of ""a kind of explanation."" "
1,"One facet of language that Dr. McWorther discusses, which I find particularly interesting,
is the way language evolved due to the evolution of the sounds used in a language, as mentioned
at 8 minutes and 13 seconds. He uses the sounds of sock (‘s’, ‘ah’, ‘k’) and describes how each
sound could evolve into other sounds, like ‘s’ becoming ‘sh’. I had never conceptualized how
differently the same word can be said until it’s a different word entirely. I’ve noticed differences
in accents when speaking English, but I hadn’t considered how a drastic change in how a word is
pronounced could make it no longer mutually intelligible and begin to be considered a word of a
separate language. I found this so profound because of something discussed in one of the
readings. Sounds not important to the language or languages you speak aren’t as easily
recognized or replicable. I would have never considered this transition because I’m not
accustomed to these other sounds and don’t think of them as similar to each other in a way that
one could evolve into the other.
As someone majoring in a language, I find the features of languages and the evolution of
language to be something important I should understand. I’m currently taking Linguistics of ASL
alongside this class, so I like to look at what I learn about languages in general and try to apply
them to ASL. For example, a sound or phoneme in ASL would be a part of a sign. One example
of how the parts of signs can look different is the sign for “decide”. The sign for “decide”
consists of many parts, the first part being tapping your temple with your index finger. Some
people tap the side of their face a bit lower, somewhere on their cheek. The same sign, but it
looks different, is like the same word being pronounced differently. The same can be said for the
words “know” and “why”. Both are words that are often signed at the temple or lower on the
cheek. This is particularly interesting in ASL because hand placement is very important in this
language, yet there are many examples of altered hand placement (usually with the start of the
sign sliding lower) still producing the same word.",99,"Hi Taleah, this is a fascinating application of the course concepts to your own interest. You perfectly demonstrated that the rules of language change apply to all human languages, whether signed or spoken. I really enjoyed your specific ASL word examples. 

While it's minor, for your future assignments, watch out for punctuation rules (e.g., 'decide.') and spelling (e.g., McWhorter, not McWorther)."
1,"I think this video was extremely engaging and a great introduction to the language families of the world. At the very beginning, I found it especially interesting that there were so many languages that evolved from a single initial language. (2:21) Dr. McWorther explains that some people happen to assume that language arose several times which is not very true and quite frankly what I also believed. I always thought that language came from many different parts of the world and developed by proximity but Dr. McWorther’s explanation really helped me understand why that couldn't be possible mostly since it would mean that there would be certain people who do not speak. Another thing that I found very interesting were the topics that Dr. McWorther discussed about the way that language changes. (8:03) He explains that one of the reasons why language changes are due to sounds changing over generations, where people tend to pronounce things differently. From my own personal experience, when I first moved to Florida, there have been many times where I would mispronounce certain words incorrectly even though other people could still understand what I meant to say. (13:36) Dr. McWorther also mentions how words meanings drift into new ones all the time, resulting in language changes as well. He explains that several words in English such as bra, merry and pretzel all developed from a word that just meant “short”. It’s wonderful to think of how many other languages possibly came up with words that meant something completely different before. This part of the video actually made me wonder of all the words in Turkish that could have evolved from other languages since it is my first language. (20:30) I also got to learn about my language family for the first time called Altaic which I thought was really cool! ",98,"Hi Selen, you did a great job detailing the sound shifts and semantic drift in the video and connecting the course material to your personal background. For your future assignments, please pay attention to typos. You misspelled the speaker's name as ""McWorther"" (it is McWhorter) several times. "
1,"In the film Language Families of the World, Dr. McWhorter claims that literacy is holding
back the evolution of language (00:16:50-00:18:27). Literacy constrains the natural
evolution of language, as written text is deemed the exemplary model of the language,
leading us to stick to it. This changed my perspective on what it means to speak English
correctly.
In America, we are introduced to diverse cultures and languages, which change the way
English is spoken, especially in areas with high immigrant populations and strong foreign
influence. In Florida, there is a noticeable Spanish and African American influence on
speech, and it is instilled in the education system to use formal English, so students must
learn to differentiate and code-switch between spoken English and written English.
Literacy has brought an interesting linguistic phenomenon in which there is an established
version of a language that is prescribed as the linguistic norm and latches onto a language
preventing it from deviating too drastically.
It is frowned upon when people speak English that doesn’t conform to the formal written
English which is a sign that they are not interacting with literature enough however it is
misunderstood that people who use improper English are not soaking up the language and
are less educated. It goes without saying that people are adapting to the language spoken
around them which is a natural process. I always thought of linguistics as just the analysis
of the rules and structures of language, but I never realized that the study of linguistics is a
naturally occurring development that does not have rights or wrongs. Having literacy is not
something that I think is bad for freezing languages from changing but growing up around
classism and xenophobia where there are negative connotations around speaking English
improperly, It is reality warping to realize that language is naturally prone to change due to
a multitude of reasons ( ex. foreign interactions that’s cause mixing of vocabulary or other
elements, contractions of words for simplification, changes in pronunciation throughout
time, etc.) and a deviation from standard language is not inherently bad or a sign of lower
intelligence.",99,"Hi Lillian, this is a powerful reflection. You've shown a clear understanding of prescriptivism and descriptivism. Your observation about growing up in Florida is an excellent example. 

For your future assignments, please pay attention to your sentence structure and punctuation. For example, the sentence beginning ""It is frowned upon..."" is a run-on sentence that lacks necessary commas and conjunctions, making it difficult to read. You also need to watch your formatting within parentheses; you wrote with an unnecessary space at the start. "
1,"One topic that Dr. John McWhorter brings up in ""Language Families of the World"" that I found especially interesting is how quickly some languages can change, especially creole languages. This comes up around Episode 1 at about 7 minutes and 40 seconds. In this part of the video, Dr. McWhorter explains that even though language families are usually formed over very long periods of time, some languages develop much faster because of social situations like colonization and contact between many different language groups. He explains that creole languages often form within just one or two generations when people who don’t share a common language are forced to communicate. These languages are sometimes incorrectly thought of as simplified versions of European languages, but Dr. McWhorter makes it clear that this isn’t true. Creole languages have their own grammar rules and structures, just like any other language. Because they develop so quickly, they can end up looking very different from the languages they came from, which makes them harder to place into traditional language family trees.

I found this especially interesting because it made me rethink how languages grow and change. Before watching this video, I always assumed that language change happened very slowly and evenly over hundreds or thousands of years. Learning that languages can shift rapidly depending on social and historical conditions made language feel more connected to real people and real events. This idea connects to my own experiences with my native language, especially when it comes to Portuguese, I’ve noticed that Portuguese speakers from different regions often sound very different and use different words or sentence structures. For example, Brazilian Portuguese can sound completely different from Portuguese spoken in Portugal. After watching this video, I realized these differences aren’t wrong or lazy versions of the language, but natural results of history and language contact. Overall, this part of the documentary helped me see language as something flexible and constantly changing, shaped by human interaction rather than strict rules.",100,"
Hi Ciara, great job on this. You've correctly identified that Creole languages are complex, fully developed linguistic systems. Your comparison to Portuguese is excellent. "
1,"One topic that Dr. McWorther brings up that I find especially intriguing is how languages change. In the video, at 6 minutes 21 seconds, the speaker explains that language is “inherently changeable”, meaning over time the languages that different societies use have to gradually change. There are three different changes that can happen; sound changes, the addition of prefixes and suffixes, and meaning changes. This fact from the lecture stuck out to me quite a bit, as these changes are things I have noticed in my environment growing up. Being from the South, my daily grammar and vocabulary is quite different than someone who was raised in another part of the United States. Words like ""ain't"" and ""y'all"" are natural for me and other southerners to use in any linguistic context, even though they aren't typically grammatically correct. For example, a common utilization of the word ""ain't"" in the South would be ""I ain't never been here before."" Ordinarily, you would use the word ""have"" instead of ""ain't"", but the widespread use has allowed for this grammatical error to pass as natural in most situations. Another characteristic unique to the South is vowels being drawn out or changed. One common example is the word ""oil"". While this word is originally pronounced with two syllables, like ""oy-yull"", in the south it is common to hear it as one syllable, like ""ull"". These southern characteristics of language falls in line with the changes Dr. McWorther's described, specifically the sound and meaning of words changing. Later in the video at 16 minutes 58 seconds, he also explains that print and literacy slow languages from adapting, as they hold people to standards and assumptions they wouldn't have while speaking. In this scenario, the sound changes I explained before get lost in messages online, and cannot be spread. In addition to this, typical grammar rules of English can encourage southern speakers to write more formally, or by the rules of the original grammar rather than cultural linguistics. Overall, printing of language slows the process of it changing, and it can replace cultural meaning for a more traditional structure. All of these characteristics make language unique, and is an interesting topic that can explain the intricacies of why languages sound the way they do.",98,"
Hi Emily, this is a great analysis of Southern American English. However, in linguistics, we try to avoid calling features like ""ain't"" grammatical errors. They are actually grammatically correct within the rules of Southern dialect; they just follow a different set of rules than Standard Written English. 

For your future assignments, please watch your subject-verb agreement (""These southern characteristics...falls"" should be ""fall""). Also, try to be consistent with capitalization. You correctly capitalized 'the South' in your first paragraph, but later wrote 'in the south' in lowercase."
1,"In Video 1 at 7 minutes and 35 seconds, Dr. McWorther starts to discuss how sound
changes start language change. He demonstrates how the sound from the word ‘sock’ can
become ‘shawk’, then ‘zhoo’, and then ‘jue’ due to people pronouncing different parts of
the word differently. These different pronunciations may be due to an odd jaw, old age, or
slang, but they can accumulate over generations to a completely different sound. I found
this interesting because previously, I did not consider how the way we say words in English
might have originated. One example of this is at 10 minutes and 45 seconds, where Dr.
McWorther showed how the ‘gh’ part of ‘through’ dropped off from the word over time.
Previously, I considered language as mostly static, but that demonstration showed me that
languages are dynamic.
This is evident in my own life. I am a CS major, and my hobbies are gaming, reading, and
watching TV or YouTube. Each of my hobbies relies on different ways of communicating
with others. Multiplayer games allow you to speak with someone from a different country
who might use a different sound closer to their first language. Different media personalities
from YouTube or Television might say a different pronunciation of a word that others might
unconsciously imitate. Microphone or Internet quality can also change how people hear a
word, which might change how you interpret it. These are all different ways of how the way
we pronounce certain sounds could change, which is what Dr. McWorther demonstrated.
This movie completely changed how I view language. as now I realize that introducing new
words as slang isn’t the only way that words change.
As per the CS major, with the introduction of AI chatbots generating content, certain words
or turns of phrase might be perpetuated more on social media. One common thing I’ve
seen from chatbots is the emdash.",98,"
Hi Joshua, great job on this. I appreciated your unique observation about microphone quality in gaming. I also liked your point regarding AI chatbots and their overuse of specific punctuation like the em-dash. However, your essay ends abruptly. The final paragraph needs to be either expanded or discarded. "
1,"What I found intriguing was the information that Dr. McWorther discussed on the development of prefixes and suffixes, particularly his discussion with the word slow-like developing into slowly (at Video 11 mins and 49 seconds - 12 mins and 3 seconds).  He discusses the fact that the suffix -ly came from the word like, for example, slowly came from slow-like and only came from one-like. He mentions how we are still able to apply the original form of how the words were pronounced before their abbreviations, and this now gives me the knowledge that words such as happily come from the original word happy-like. He also mentions that if you say a word or a group of words enough times and fast enough, it always has the potential to become something different, which is what essentially happens over the years in the process of language development. The fact that humans are capable of producing so many different sounds, tones, and dialects of various types of languages, and how this very thing contributes to their development. I personally was unaware that the ending -ly was derived from the word ""like,"" and this change only came about because of how many times humans would say it in their own accents. I was also aware that this also contributes to the stripping away of the meaning of prefixes and suffixes independently. These things I can imagine contribute to the development of many different vernaculars and slang for all types of cultures. I know the changing of words and pronunciations I see all the time on social media, like the word ""rizz,"" which is short for charisma, but has kind of become its own unique thing separate from just using the word charisma itself. In today's society, I feel like there is a lot more creativity involved in creating new words and slang in an attempt to appeal to audiences through all types of media, especially social media apps such as TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. ",98,"Hi Maria, you did a great job identifying the suffix formation and connecting it to a perfect modern example! 

For your next assignment, please proofread your work for typos (e.g., McWorther -> McWhorter) and grammar (e.g., the sentence ""the fact that humans are... contributes to their development"" lacks a main verb.). 

Overall, this was a highly engaging reflection. "
1,"In the lecture film entitled ""Language Families of the World"", Dr. McWorther made mention of
the functionality and comprehension of languages with little to no sound. This phenomenon
piqued my interest, as it unveils an unprecedented thought that language can exist almost
silently.
For example, at approximately 25':59"" of the video, Dr. McWorther discusses the language of
the Amazon, Pirahaã, housing only 8 consonants and 5 vowels. A few seconds later, he
expands on this phenomenon by describing languages in Africa, such as Berber. The Berber
language possesses an absence of vowels in many of their words, which defies the customary
structure of languages to have at least 1-3 vowels in almost every word. 'A' in ""Cat"" for English,
""O"" and ""U"" in ""Cou Cou"" for French, ""E"", ""A"", ""O"" in ""Dejado"" for Spanish, yet, Berber isolates
itself by the commonly perceived impossible.
He gives reason to these occurrences due to the family history of the language and its
developed particularities. Thus, it has highlighted to me how languages may share common
traits and aspects like retaining a syntax and lexicon, but their structural variation can be vastly
different, but remain just as relevant for a society. The concept becomes truly captivating as one
reflects on language being completely independent of sound, because of the creativity and
innate motivation of humans to communicate and socialize with one another.
Case in point, occasionally my mother will sieze the perfect opportunity to speak with me during
a moment I am unable to. Often, this moment involves me swishing around the mouthwash in
my mouth. I reject the idea of stopping and restarting my rinse, so I desperately try
communicating with muffled, yet intentional sounds. Funnily enough, the conversation always
has a 99% success rate in conveying information. This experience, though overdone, validates
Dr. McWorther 's claim that language is always adapting as humans change their
communication preferences regardless of how clear speech is conducted.",94,"
Hi Robyn, you did a great job selecting the examples of Pirahã and Berber to illustrate linguistic variation. I also found your ""mouthwash"" analogy to be a very humorous way to demonstrate how intention often overrides phonetic clarity in communication! 

For your next assignment, please pay attention to spelling and phrasing:

McWorther should be McWhorter
Pirahaã should be Pirahã
sieze should be seize
""The Berber language possesses... in many of their words"" should be ""its words."" 
Run-ons: ""'A' in 'Cat' for English..."" hangs loosely. It would be better asa complete sentence. 
Overall, very engaging essay! "
1,"In the Video at 26:43 Dr. McWhorter mentions the Berber languages that have words that have no vowels at all, and that often times it sounds like they are just whispering due to the lack of vowels. I found this particularly interesting because many languages have constraints that dont allow certain consonant clusters or virtually any at all so a language that is the opposite extreme of that is fascinating to me. I know that often times when listening to people talk I tend to pay more attention to the consonants rather than the vowels when deciphering speech especially because I feel like dialectal variations of English tend to vary more in terms of vowels so different vowel usage is still more typically understood than different consonant usage. I feel that this is also makes sense from a phonetic standpoint because consonants being determined by a specific obstruction of air makes them more concrete compared to vowels which exist on a broad continuum. When I take notes if the lecture is moving too fast for me to keep up and I want to make sure I do not miss anything something that I have done before is write words with minimal vowel usage to make it faster to write. I have found that this often works well for me because I can still read the notes after the fact because typically the vowels are somewhat redundant. For example instead of writing “The widespread and immense usage of underdeveloped ideas is a plague to society” I might write “the widsprd & immnse usage of undrdevlpd ideas is a plague to society” it makes often not a very large difference but sometimes it adds up quick how much time it saves to serve its purpose. In that way I can see how it would be possible to understand how a word can still exist without vowels as I often intentionally drop vowels like I described. ",97,"
Hi Alexander, you did a great job describing the difference between the vowels and consonants in terms of place of articulation. 

For your future assignments, however, be careful with grammar and punctuation. For example, the sentence starting ""When I take notes..."" is over 50 words long and lacks commas to separate the clauses. "
1,"One topic that Dr. McWhorter discusses in Language Families of the World that I found especially interesting is the idea that languages are always changing and that no language is more “advanced” or “primitive” than another. This comes up early in video 1, around 11 minutes, when he explains how languages naturally evolve over time through changes in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. To make this idea more concrete, he uses the word “sock” as an example, showing how its pronunciation has shifted gradually across generations without speakers being aware of it.

Dr. McWhorter explains that many people assume language change means that a language is getting worse or being used incorrectly. However, from a linguistic perspective, change is simply part of how language works. Languages are constantly adjusting, often becoming simpler in one area while becoming more complex in another. For instance, a language may lose certain word endings but depend more heavily on word order, or drop some verb forms while developing new supporting words. These kinds of changes do not indicate decline; they show that a language is continuing to develop.

This part of the film was especially meaningful to me because it connects to conversations I have heard throughout my life. Older family members often comment that people today “don’t speak correctly anymore,” especially when they hear slang or informal speech. Before watching this film, I tended to view these changes as negative. However, learning that even a basic word like “sock” once sounded different helped me realize that every generation speaks a slightly different version of the same language.

This topic also relates to my academic interests because it changes how I think about learning languages. Instead of seeing grammar rules as fixed and permanent, I now understand them as patterns that formed over time and may continue to shift. Viewing language this way makes it feel more natural and less rigid. Overall, this discussion helped me better understand why language change is normal and why it should be studied rather than criticized.",99,"Hi Esther, this is a very clear and accurate summary of one of the course's most important themes. You correctly identified that languages don't ""decay"" or get ""worse""; they simply trade complexity in one area for simplicity in another. Your connection to your older family members' complaints is relevant. 

For your future assignments, you can push for a slightly more critical voice. Instead of just summarizing the main points, try to apply them to a specific example of ""bad"" grammar you've heard recently to show why it's actually linguistically valid. "
1,"“Why Are there so Many Languages?” (13 minutes 44 seconds)
Dr. McWorther discusses the meaning of words evolving over time and across languages.
His example of how ‘bra’, ‘merry’, and ‘pretzel’ in English originated from the ancient
Ukrainian work for ‘short’. He expands the most on how ‘merry’ was formed from the
possibility that the Ukrainian word for ‘short’ was associated with an undesirable
attendance that did not last long and, therefore, was a merry thing. Over the decades and
centuries, the Ukrainian word lost its original meaning of ‘short’ to mean ‘merry’ in English.
I find this interesting because I was unaware that Ukrainian is a distant relative of English. I
had a little knowledge of language families prior to watching the film, so most of his lecture
material was new for me. I did know that English was part of the Germanic language family,
and in my mind, Ukrainian is a distant language developed far enough to prevent influence.
It amazes me how small shifts in pronunciation or context can generate entirely new
vocabulary. I see this happening constantly on a smaller scale online, where the internet
enables rapid exchange of ideas and expressions. Language evolves every single day.
The second part I found interesting was Dr. McWorther claiming “print and literacy tend to
hold change back in a language” (16 minutes and 56 seconds). While that makes sense, it
never occurred to me that a general population understanding a language means the
development of said language goes slower. Languages have always been an interest of
mine. I tried learning Spanish in high school but stopped to learn Portuguese instead.
While I never finished learning either, I have kept some of the words and phrases that
resonated with me. Seeing something similar happen in a professional and large-scale
settings reminds me that I am connected to humanity in delicate ways.",95,"
Hi Samantha, great job identifying the ""meery/pretzel/bra"" connection! Your reflection on how the internet accelerates language change was also a very smart observation. I'd like to see more specific examples for your next assignments, though. 

Additionally, for your next essays, please proofread for sentence fragments; the sentence 'His example of how...' lacks a main verb. Also, double-check your word choice. You wrote 'Ukrainian work' instead of 'word,' and 'undesirable attendance' when you likely meant 'occurrence' or 'event.' Finally, be sure to spell the speaker's name correctly (McWhorter, not McWorther). "
1,"In the film Language Families of the World, I found it particularly interesting when Dr.
McWhorter spoke about how some people say there are 7,000 languages (splitters), but he
thinks there are around 6,000, since he is what would be called a “lumper” (Video 1, 0’:8”).
Specifically, later in the video, he said that South America had at least 15 language
families, but splitters would say around 177, which he claims is way too much (Video 1,
22’:11”). This really surprised and interested me because my dad comes from Costa Rica,
which is more Central America, but I have grown up with people from all over South
America. It is so interesting to learn about all the different dialects of Spanish. At my job, I
tend to help a lot with people who only speak Spanish, so I hear people from all over
constantly and I can, for the most part, correctly guess where people come from based on
their slang and accents. That being said, it is hard to believe there are around 15 families
just in that one part of the world. In the past, I thought South America was mostly
Portuguese in Brazil and Spanish with multiple dialects, so it is cool to know that there is
so much more to it than that. I also found it interesting that he said that sounds can change
due to short distances between them (Video 1, 8’, 40”). He also mentions that this does
not happen overnight, but through generations (same time stamp). That makes me wonder
more about the everyday words we say now, and how they were pronounced even just 100
years ago. Does that mean that accents also change over time? Like Dr. McWhorter's
example of how people say they “cot” a fish instead of “caught” (Video 1,9’: 22”). I learned
in psychology that the mind takes shortcuts to remember only what it deems important,
and I wonder if that can sometimes happen with how the brain/ mouth remembers words,
and how to speak faster.",99,"
Hi Bianca, you did a great job connecting the concept of ""lumpers vs. splitters"" to your personal experience with Spanish dialects. I also really appreciated your interdisciplinary connection to psychology—it is a brilliant insight! For your next assignments, watch out for sentence fragments; the sentence starting with ""Like Dr. McWhorter's example..."" is incomplete and should be connected to your previous thought. "
1,"In the video “Language Families of the World,” the fact that I found most intriguing was Dr. John McWhorter’s argument about the nature of language change.  In video 1, 6 min 30 seconds, he introduces his idea: “I mean that language has to change in the same way that clouds have to change.” He means that language does not remain unchanged, but it is a dynamic process that “can’t help but change” as stated in video 1, 6 min 45 seconds. In video 1, 6 min 45 seconds, he also said that “So if one group of humans splits off from another one, then their versions of the language start drifting away, just like clouds, you know the horsies up in the sky become, you know, astronauts and then you know mucus or whatever, they start drifting until they're no longer the same language at all”. Languages literally change over time. When groups of people move apart and stop talking to each other, their way of speaking goes in different directions. After centuries, these changes split one original language into many distinct languages. This slow change is the primary reason why we have thousands of different languages these days.

I find this perspective interesting because it defines language transformation as the flow of human culture. It also shows the differences among various languages. It relates to my personal experience as a person who can speak multiple languages. For instance, I notice clear differences in vocabulary and pronunciation between Vietnamese and English. While Vietnamese uses tones to change words meanings (around 6 tones), English has stress patterns and intonation but lacks the lexical tones of languages. That is the reason why when I first learned English, I could not speak fluently. My initial struggle to learn English effectively was about memorizing new words and trying to force my thinking and pronouncing those words reasonably. Dr. McWhorter’s cloud analogy captures this perfectly. Understanding this has changed how I think about languages. Now, I perceive each language as more than a practical tool. This idea helps me appreciate the beauty and uniqueness in every language that I try to speak.",96,"Hi Tuan, you did a wonderful job engaging with Dr. McWhorter's ""cloud"" analogy. Your comparison between Vietnamese and English was a specific & excellent way to illustrate the different directions languages can take over time. 

For your next assignments, be careful not to rely too heavily on long block quotes; the section you quote, ""So if one group of humans....the same language at all,"" took up a significant portion of your essay. It is better to paraphrase these long sections in your own words to show your understanding. "
1,"This is the second time I have viewed this lecture, the first time being in a linguistics class I took a few years ago. We discussed things like pidgins and creoles, but I feel like we didn't truly acknowledge how amazing the development of language is. What interested me then and now is the topic Dr. McWorther discusses from 3:02-3:12. During this time, he discusses how languages evolved from one singular language in East Africa, just like how humans developed from one shared ancestor. I have always found this interesting because the entire concept of language, a non-physical thing moving and developing alongside humans, the same way they evolved physically, is astounding. Something that has no real form journeyed and surfaced all over the world and even created offshoots of itself (pidgins, creoles, etc.) Not only that, but it began to have the same social constructs as race/ethnicity. For example, Haitian Creole vs French. 

Haitian Creole would be considered a lower language and a less ""correct"" form of French. Standard French would be a higher language because it's the language in its purest form. But despite the form, they are both types of languages. I use this specifically because when I took French in middle school, my friend who moved to Florida from Haiti showed me the note our French teacher wrote on her assignment. She wrote that my friend still needed practice even if she spoke Creole. They would communicate and be able to understand each other, which I thought was impressive. But it just reminds me of the fact that society constrains so many things into boxes. Some races/ethnicities are seen as ""lower"" despite us all having evolved from the same ancestors. It's the same with language; regardless of whether it's not the purest form, a creole, or a pidgin, it is a language being spoken by individuals who value it. ",99,"Hi De'Stiny, you went beyond the basic mechanics of language change to discuss the sociolinguistic implications of hierarchy and prestige. Your personal anecdote about your friend is a perfect (and heartbreaking) example of how varieties are treated differently in society. My only correction is to double-check the spelling of the speaker's name (McWhorter, not McWorther). "
1,"In the video, “Language Families of the World,” the main ideology that stuck out to me was
the idea that “Language is inherently changeable.” This idea is brought up in “Language
Families of the World” in 6 minutes and 20 seconds.
At this timestamp, Dr. McWorther brings up the idea that language is inherently
changeable, saying that language has to change the same way clouds and the stuff around
us changes. He mentions that this occurs because as humans split up, their language gets
split up from the previous humans they interacted with and then start forming it into their
own with the new group of humans and language, causing the language to change.
I find this ideology extremely interesting because after further realization, every person is
able to see how this point works in their daily life. I have noticed that in my friend group we
will often make up our own words that are spin-offs of other words that end up going in our
vocabulary jokingly. Even though it begins as a joke, it ends up being part of our groups'
word usage often. This shows how the creative human mind can take previous knowledge
(language in this example) and create new types of it or create changes to it. Not only does
this ideology appear in my personal life, but it is shown in every generation. One of the
most notable examples of change in language is easily slang. Slang is used very often in a
lot of people's speech and language, while being seen all over social media. Slang being
used primarily over social media is sort of a wildfire for change in language, social media is
now the biggest form of content sharing in the world and almost 70% of the world has
social media allowing 70% of the world to have the chance to inherit a new slang term to
their language for them to possibly break off and use their creativity to change or improve
that slang term in their own way.
This ideology is vastly interesting because there are so many ways that language can be
changed, inherited, broken off, and much more, but the truth is that Dr. McWorther’s point
is correct, and language does have to change.",97,"Hi Fady, you've done a great job illustrating the organic nature of language change. Your example of your friend group inventing words as a joke that eventually become serious vocabulary is a perfect description of neologisms. 

For your future assignments, be careful with word choice. You repeatedly use the word ""ideology"" to describe Dr. McWhorter's point. However, an ideology is a system of beliefs. Using ""concept,"" ""phenomenon,"" or ""principle"" would be much more accurate here. Also, watch out for run-on sentences. "
1,"Dr. McWorther surprised me many times in his discussion. To start, I am guilty of saying “rah fish” in my pronunciation rather than stressing the end of the true word, “raw,” in “raw fish.” My jaw dropped! What I found most intriguing about language was between minutes 12:30 and 13:29. He reflects on our own language, starting with the word “only.” The word we pronounce within it is “own,” which is used to describe just one thing. So, if a word within it already conveys this meaning, why is there an “ly” that follows it?

He then uses the word “forgive” as another example. We know its meaning is to no longer feel angry or resentful towards another, and we can utilize “give” in its pronunciation to convey this. But what is “for,” and why is it there? Because the sections we pronounce in our speech used to be prefixes from whole words. In modern usage, they now serve as added blubber to the word.

It was interesting because I never examined my own speech. What makes our word choices have their particular pronunciation, structure, and meaning? As a political science major, the evolution of language that “puffs up"" connects to how politics and policy are often constructed. It takes an accumulation of people over time to shift how something is said. Whether words are shortened, elongated, or given new meanings, new material is applied as older vocabulary slowly withers away.

This principle can be compared to customary international law in my studies, which refers to laws people believe have always existed, even when they have not, due to normalized practice. What is astounding about the evolution of language is that there is no concrete rule declaring when words must shift in meaning or when sounds like “ly” or “for” are added. There are not always clear explanations we can derive, other than knowing these components must have meant something different at one point and now contribute to the full word.

In the same way, customary international law becomes respected and embedded without much thought because it is so commonly followed. For example, the norm against attacking fishing boats in international waters during times of political chaos. No formal international law initially declared this, but the practice became so natural that countries around the world respected it. Language operates in the same way. I do not think twice about pronouncing parts of words that no longer carry independent meaning because I have assumed, “well, it’s just like that.” This section opened up how I perceive language and its connection to my passion for political science.",96,"
Hi Sofia, this is a great cross-disciplinary connection. Comparing language change to Customary International Law is a brilliant analogy. I also want to clarify the etymology you mentioned: ""Only"" actually comes from ""one"" + ""ly,"" not ""own."" For your future assignments, please double-check the spelling of the professor's name. It is McWhorter, not McWorther. "
2,"The German film resonates with other children of other cultures since it discusses universal concerns about intimacy, sincerity, and confidentiality in phones. Although the location and jokes are German, the major issue one of the individuals sharing personal texts with friends is something that resonates with most people in relationships today. Smartphones have become an extension of us, our secrets, desires, and other lives, which we would hardly describe to the people that we are close to.

The movie is appealing to the people globally because it considers ways in which we strike a balance between being open and guarding our feelings. It is always good to tell the truth in love and friendship, which the film demonstrates can damage such relationships. This is the same issue all around the world: in several societies, individuals consider the extent to which they share and conceal to maintain a serene setting.

An extremely good illustration of this occurs when in Video 1 at around 27 minutes, the group plays a phone game and the messages that reveal cheating and the disguised identity are received. In this section, the partner is informed that the relationship with her was not entirely truthful. The clumsy behavior, the blatant jokes, and the defense during dinner indicate how ordinary individuals behave when their emotional comfort is at stake. This is true to every culture since it reveals a collective fear: that somebody who you trusted the most has a secret life you never knew about.

The German movie succeeds by setting this struggle within the context of usual social circumstances: long-term relationships, married friends, civil dinner conversations, and allowing the dark side to disrupt the appearance. Ultimately, the film succeeds in any place since it is not based on a culture-specific problem but human weakness which remains the same, regardless of language, nation or civilization.",83,"
Hi Areebah, you did a good job identifying the film's central theme regarding the universal fear that out loved ones have secret lives. However, your essay is quite vague, by not including name characters (referring only to ""the partner"" or ""the group""). Next time, please be more specific dand analyze the dynamics more deeply. 

Regarding your citation, it appears that the scene in Video 1 at 27 minutes actually focuses on a discussion about ""normal life"" (marriage and children) rather than the cheting reveal you metnioned. For your next assignment, please double check your citation and provide the exact timestamp (e.g., Video 1, 27:14) rather than approximations. 

Lastly, be careful with word choice and grammar (e.g., missing prepositions, fragmented clauses). Regaridng the word choice, for example, you said ""The German film resonates with other children..."" Using ""children"" implies the movie is for kids or only young people are watching, which is incorrect. "
2,"The film “A Perfect Secret” has many universally applicable themes, to the point where language
isn’t a barrier for the viewer watching. In the beginning of the movie, Eva suggests a game of “coming
clean”, which becomes the whole plot of the movie (A Perfect Secret, Video 1, 19:25). The rules of this
game are explained as follows; any notification will be read out loud to the group, and any phone call will
be answered on speaker phone. Some of the friends are uneasy in giving their phone up, or even forget to
turn it off airplane mode like Simon. This underlying uneasiness is something many people feel when
giving up their cellular device, no matter the language they speak. This is due to how us humans like
privacy, and can be secretive at times. I find this to be very universal, as it applies to all friendships and
relationships. There is a lot of mistreatment and cheating in every part of the world. In terms of
friendship, others do not want texts regarding gossip to be shared with everyone. Both romantic and
nonromantic relationships are strained in this movie, where one thing leads to another. This can also be
seen in the real world, where a message coming across the wrong way to someone could lead to a blowout
and the ending of many relationships. Another reason this theme is so universally applicable is the use of
emotion within it. In some languages, emotions can be verbally stated in various ways. However, us as
humans can recognize anger, sadness, and madness with little to no struggle. Despite not understanding
the actual words coming out of the characters mouths, the facial expressions that the characters emit can
tell us a lot. These expressions, especially when made towards another character, let the viewer better
understand the strain on relationships this game causes, showing further worldwide application.",96,"Great job on this, Diana! 

You've correctly identified the central tension of the film. You also make an interesting point about the universality of emotion. 

However, your analysis would be stronger if you dug deeper into why we keep secrets. Also, please proofread for grammar: ""This is due to how us humans..."" should be ""how we humans."" "
2,"In the Perfect Secret in video 1 at 21:51 the conversation to something small but, very accurate. Leo's habit of always placing his phone face-own. On the surface it is framed as a joke. However, instantly, it triggers suspicion, side-eyes and creates tension at the table. Everyone at the table assumes what that behavior usually signals, even before anything incriminating takes place. This scene works across cultures because the behavior itself has become a global social queue, regardless of country, or language. Putting your phone down in a social romantic setting is widely seen as; the person has something to hide, such as they are cheating on their partner, do not want to be distracted by social media notifications or they are attempting to keep eavesdroppers away. The interpretation is not taught formally, I believe it is learned behavior through shared digital experience. Digital devices such as smartphones have created a silent body language, and Leo's uncomfortable gesture speaks louder than any of the words he spoke attempting to defend his behavior. What makes this moment universal isn't Leo's suspected cheating specifically. It is the pattern recognition, in friendships and romantic relationships alike. We as people notice changes in behavior more than simple actions. I believe Leo putting his phone down speaks to a deeper truth. When someone attempts to preserve their privacy and rights, why do others feel the need to judge that person's actions based on their own insecurities and lack of trust? Even if someone is not cheating, the lack of transparency creates a narrative that makes the other party feel entitled and uncomfortable, when truly they have no right to be because we are all entitled to privacy.",90,"
Hi Larry, your observation that placing a phone face-down is a universally learned gesture of secrecy is an excellent insight. However, your essay contains 282 words a total. To reach the word count and improve your essay, you could have analyzed why Leo defends himself. 

Additionally, be careful with word choice (e.g., ""queue""), grammar (e.g., ""seen as;""), and typos (e.g., ""phone face-own""). "
2,"After watching this film, I really enjoyed the different types of languages and gestures that they used
while transitioning from one scene to another and trying to portray their characters. Although it was
filmed in a different language, I was still able to understand, and thought it was interesting how similar
the techniques were between our language and theirs. Our understanding of the theme of exposing
everyone's secrets could be different from someone from another country. The changes of emotions were
frequent, and the different verbiage that was used among the characters is different than what we are used
to now. There were certain terms that were used by the characters that would not be allowed in American
culture today. Something that is classified as a derogatory term today might not have been seen as such if
someone from another country or religion were watching this. In (Video 2 at 36 minutes and 50 seconds),
she uses a term that in our language is considered hateful against gay people. I feel that this film can
connect and be very universal to a lot of people because of how each one of us grew up and how we were
taught to view things. There are many different perspectives in which someone can take that. The whole
theme of this film was to expose people's secrets and find out what everyone is hiding in their phones. We
were able to see that throughout, and a lot of things were brought to light. What I noticed with almost
everyone's secret was that either they were not in a trustworthy relationship or didn’t really love one
another. In different cultures and religions, it is okay to have more than one significant other, but in other
religions, you have one partner, and that's it. Somebody who is from another culture might think that it
was okay that many of them are cheating and have normalized it. Another section in the film I want to
point out is in (video 2 at 29 minutes and 54 seconds). They bring up the gay and homophobic topic and
everyone speaks on it as if it's such a casual matter. It is something so serious in America and in other
places, it may not be so tough. You never know where someone is from, so we all have different points of
view from watching this film. From watching this film, we can connect the different traditions and
customs people are used to and bring them all together. Everyone is different, and in this film, you can see
the diversity that it reaches and how there are many ways to watch it and learn something different from it
each time.",94,"
Hi Marley, you have taken an interesting approach by focusing on how the film highlights cultural differences. However, the question asks why this story has been adapted into 18 different languages. That said, why does it work everywhere? While cultural norms do vary, the universal appeal of this film lies in the secret of the smartphone. 

For future assignments, make sure you directly address the core question, and then you might want to connect this to your own perspective. Also, your essay is 450 words, and try to fit into the 300-400 word range. 

Overall, great job! "
2,"The film Das perfekte Geheimnis (The Perfect Secret) touches on several themes that
transcend culture and language identity, especially when it comes to romantic relationships and
the expectations often placed on them. For instance, beginning at the 26:40 mark, the group
discusses the decision to have children and the role it plays in one’s life.
The argument made by Carlotta that kids are the best thing in life is quickly rebuffed by
Pepe, who feels that it’s absurd to think that a life without kids is senseless or without purpose.
Whether a couple decides to have children is often a personal choice that may depend on a
number of factors - including cultural and societal expectations. This is the case across a
disparate range of countries, cultures and language groups. The specific ideologies or
philosophies may differ from one group sharing a language, country or culture to another, but
the experience of considering conflicting, yet widely held views is common in many parts of the
world.
In the context of the Perfetti Gang debate, it is briefly discussed whether bringing a new
life into the world is selfish. Bianca suggests that having a child is for the betterment of the
world: a child is born full of potential to solve problems currently plaguing the world. On the
other hand, it can be self-serving for parents to have children out of a fear of getting older, an
idea that Eva poses. In the United States and other Western countries, environmental concerns
have given momentum to a movement of voluntary childlessness, giving way to the idea that
continuing the human population is selfish and not in the best interest of the planet.
Simultaneously, in the same countries exist “pronatalist” movements, which promote
increasing the falling birthrate, and deem childlessness as selfish and against human interests.
This example shows that the actual reasons why some would see having or not having children
as selfish may differ from place to place – in this case Germany and the United States – but
similar arguments are made in each case. In this way, the film demonstrates that many couples
face similar considerations across the globe when planning a future together.",99,"Hi Alexis, great job on this. You not only correctly identified the film's presentation but also beautifully connected it to modern environmental concerns, which demonstrates your deep understanding of why this theme is universal.
While your analysis of the argument between Carlotta and Pepe is accurate, it's worth noting Pepe's background (e.g., his being a closeted gay man in a heteronormative group), as it adds a layer to your analysis.
Lastly, your submission file contained annotations. For your next assignment, please ensure you submit a clean final version without these markup elements."
2,"The reason The Perfect Secret works so well across so many cultures is because the main idea of
the film is something almost everyone can relate to, that is that people keep secrets, even from
the people they love the most. The film explores secrecy, trust, jealousy, and the gap between
how people present themselves publicly and who they really are privately. These dynamics exist
in virtually every society, regardless of language, religion, or social norms. While the details on
culture may change, the emotional structure of relationships remains similar worldwide. You can
see that relationships everywhere are built on trust, but they are also full of things left unsaid,
which is exactly what the film displays.
One major reason the theme translates so well is the role of smartphones. No matter the culture,
phones have become deeply personal objects. They hold private conversations, emotional
connections, and sometimes secrets that partners or friends don’t know about; I can even vouch
for this. The idea of being forced to share everything on your phone instantly creates tension
because almost everyone has something they wouldn’t want to reveal in front of others. That
discomfort doesn’t depend on language or culture, it’s a shared experience.
A scene that feels especially true to real life relationships happens when the dinner guests agree
to the phone game and messages begin revealing hidden romantic tension. In the German
version, this moment comes up around video 2 at about the 32 minute mark. A message with
flirting undertones is exposed, and suddenly the mood at the table changes. What stood out to me
is that the issue isn’t outright cheating, but emotional secrecy. This reflects real relationships,
where jealousy often comes from what might be happening rather than what has already
happened. Many couples struggle with defining emotional boundaries, and this scene captures
that gray area perfectly.
What makes this moment so relatable is how quickly trust starts to unravel. The characters
become defensive, suspicious, and uncomfortable, which mirrors how people react in real life
when they feel exposed or threatened. The film shows that even small secrets can feel huge once
they’re brought into the open.
Overall, The Perfect Secret works across cultures because it’s about human behavior. Fear of
judgment, the want for self privacy, and jealousy in relationships are things people experience
everywhere, which is why the story continues to resonate worldwide and why I can relate to it.",96,"Hi Isaiah, your argument that the film works globally because it explores the ""gray area"" of relationships is excellent. You correctly identify that the tension often comes not from the act itself, but from the ambiguity of digital communication. 

However, your evidence is a bit vague. You mention a scene where a ""message with flirting undertones is exposed."" Which message? Who received it? With specifics, your analysis of the ""gray area"" would have been grounded in concrete proof. 

Overall, great job!"
2,"The Perfect Secret is a film about a group of friends (and a few of their partners) getting together for a dinner party that goes horrible sideways when they play a game that reveals what they're doing on their phones. More than that though, it's a film about privacy, secrecy, and technology and how all those things can effect relationships, whether they be platonic or romantic or sexual. I think that seeing how these characters ruin their own lives through their phones in a way that went completely unnoticed is what makes this film appealing enough that it got translated as much as it did. It speaks to the still somewhat novel experience of having an entire world in one's phone and how deeply that can effect a person's life. It also speaks to that fear that people aren't who they say they are. Tying these ideas to these very relatable relationships and characters makes them resonate deeply in a way that crosses many cultures and languages. These characters are flawed in ways that can be observed all around you if you don't have people like this already in your life or are experiencing it yourself. But beyond the commentary about technology, there is also themes that are simply about relationships. Loyalty and growing up are some of these very universal ideas. One example from the film in in video 3 at 5:32 where Pepe calls out his friends saying that they haven't been like how they were as kids in a long time. This is something that's apparent from the very beginning of the film when you can tell how strained and almost passive aggressive these ties between friends are, and that makes a lot of audiences ache, not just for these characters, but also, likely, for themselves and their own friend groups that they've outgrown. Even if their friendships didn't end as dramatically. ",97,"Hi Alexandra, you correctly identify that the tragedy isn't just about the phones, but about the realization that the ""good old days"" are gone. To strengthen your argument, you can expand on why the friends are ""passive-aggressive."" Is it because of their secrets, or because they have simply grown into different people? 

For your next assignments, please double-check your word choice (e.g., affect vs. effect) and grammar (e.g., adverb usage, subject-verb agreement). "
2,"In the movie The Perfect Secret, it focuses on something that most of us fear in almost
every relationship that we share with someone which is having our private thoughts
conversations shared with each other especially with the people who are closest to us.
This is something that can apply to people in so many different cultures because we can all
relate to it. The movie reflects how important cell phones are to individuals because it
holds personal information and some secrets that people do not feel comfortable sharing
even with the people closest to them. The situations in the film felt very realistic despite
cultural settings because cellphones are such a huge part in people's lives.
At the beginning of the movie it shows when the group agrees to start playing the phone
game and puts their phones on the table (Video 2, 14–16 minutes). Even though everyone
agrees with the rules, you can see that the uncomfortableness starts to set in. There is so
much tension in the room before any messages come in, this shows that even close
friends have things they want to keep private. As the game continues and the messages
start to be revealed, the mood quickly changes (Video 2, 35–45 minutes). Private texts are
misunderstood and cause tension between friends and couples, which shows how easily
relationships can be affected when private information is shared.
Another scene is when Leo sees his wife’s car parked on a bridge and he assumes
something bad has happened (Video 2, 1 hour and 20 minutes). Without knowing the full
situation as to why she was there in the first place, he jumps to the worst conclusion. This
feels very real because in many relationships, fear can take over when communication is
unclear.
The Perfect Secret is a great example of a film that shows what can happen in real life when
it comes to how trust can be ruined when private information is revealed, and that’s
something people can relate to no matter where they are from and regardless of culture.",98,"Hi Rajdai, You've correctly identified the film's main tension. Your reflection on this is excellent. 

For your next assignments, please proofread for repetitive use of certain words (e.g., ""something"") and run-on sentences (e.g., the first sentence). "
2,"In my opinion, not just one scene, but the whole movie appears to have a universal adaptability because it is common in every culture and country to assume that everyone has their own secrets, or as some would say, skeletons in their closet. Our smartphones, which everyone now has, have intensified reality, as our devices now hold conversations, photos, and notes that were never intended to be shared. And because everyone owns a phone and uses it privately, the movie’s message immediately seems so relatable across cultures.

I think most of the movie can relate to or apply to most relationships, as it revolves around people discovering things that were kept from them. This situation starts at approximately 18:57 in video 1, when Rocco’s wife says that everyone is claiming they don’t have secrets, and everybody agrees. and continues until the end of the second video and the start of the third, with everyone discovering each other’s deepest secrets. This moment deeply reflects how each individual behaves: publicly claiming honesty while privately fearing that their secret will be exposed. The tension of the exposure continues throughout the movie, challenging the trust and good relationships within the group.

The movie fits so well for every type of relationship, and culture, because it all has the same base - a deep, private secret that shouldn’t be exposed. And it also shows that any relationship is based on “trust,” which, in reality, is just an assumption rather than real transparency. The discomfort and arguments in this movie show how fragile relationships can become when the unspoken comes out. At the same time, reactions such as denial and anger will be the emotions that people will experience universally, regardless of their cultural background. For example, when it happened in the Video 2 at 33:41, when Simon and Carlotta find out that Leo is homosexual, Simon bursts into anger and says a lot of negative things about his orientation and how it impacts their friendship, while Carlotta goes into tears thinking again about their marriage and how it is ruined now after the secret comes out. This example shows how the issue that arises in the movie can be applied to all types of relationships.

Ultimately, the movie Perfect Secret resonates across different cultures because it highlights a universal human trait: relationships will often rely only on selective honesty, and by forcing hidden realities into the open, the movie shows how easily trust and the relationship can be fractured.


",97,"Hi Valeriia, you've constructed a strong argument that relationships often rely on selective honesty and that trust is frequently just a fragile assumption. Your connection between the universality of the film and the ubiquity of smartphones is also excellent. 

However, your analysis of the second scene (Video 2, 33:41) should have been more accurately described. You used this scene to argue that a ""deep, private secret"" was being exposed. However, Leo was mistaken for being gay because he was holding Pepe's phone; his ""secret"" wasn't actually revealed, but rather, a misunderstanding occurred. To improve this, you should either acknowledge the phone swap or choose a different example where a real secret is exposed (e.g., pregnancy reveal). 

Lastly, be careful with fragmented sentences. "
2,"The Perfect Secret is a German adaptation of an Italian film that has been adapted into about 18 different languages besides German. This film has been adapted into many different languages because it consists of universal topics/themes that can be applied to many different cultural contexts. These topics include privacy, intimacy, secrets, coming out, homophobia, self-image, fidelity, all of which can be applied in every cultural context. One topic that I would like to talk about is the fear of exposure specifically with the phone game during dinner (Video 1 at 19 min 13 seconds). Each individual puts their phone in the middle of the table for the entirety of dinner and every text or phone call gets read or heard in front of everyone. It highlights how technology can heighten the fear of exposure because phone calls and text messages are the way we communicate in society today. If your significant other reads a certain text message or call on your phone, you could possibly lose that person forever. There is a scene in the film where Carlotta gets a call from her friends and is nervous to pick it in front of everyone (Video 1 at 42 min 9 seconds). This highlights her fear of being exposed that she and her husband struggle with being intimate with each other. This also brings into light how intimacy is something all couples struggle with in any phase of their relationship. It can as they’re dating, married, or especially with kids. This film also highlights the illusion of intimacy because each individual thought they knew everything about each other, but they lacked the knowledge of their secrets. This is also something that occurs across all cultures. These topics have universal applicability because at the core it’s all human conflict instead of cultural conflict. There is no specific reference to a specific culture, but rather it reflects human behavior, modern life, secrecy, and human relationships whether romantic or friendly. ",95,"
Hi Angelina, you've done a good job identifying the illusion of intimacy as the film's central point. Your observation that the characters thought they knew everything about each other, only to realize they were actually strangers, is a strong point. 

However, I have a few suggestions for improvement. First, your opening two sentences are repetitive; I recommend combining them into one concise statement. Second, the sentence ""It can as they're dating, married..."" is a fragment because it lacks a main verb. Finally, try to be more specific with your argument about ""technology heightening fear."" It isn't the technology itself that creates the fear; it is our heavy reliance on a single device (i.e., the smartphone) to hide our lack of honesty. 

Overall, great work! "
2,"The Perfect Secret, the German adaptation of the Italian film Perfetti Sconosciuti, has achieved international success, with the original story translated into more than 18 languages worldwide today. I believe the reason why this film resonates with audiences globally is that it focuses on the universal human experience rather than culturally specific traditions. The film explores so many different facets of human social interactions: relationships, romance, and family, with situations that are universally accepted. The director worked very hard to ensure that the film had a wide range of widely accepted social interactions. The character development is very strong in this film. Instead of focusing on a single story, the director sheds light on each individual in the group. By doing so, it allows audiences from all different cultural backgrounds to recognize themselves in the characters.

A particularly relatable scene occurs very early in the film at 2 minutes and 19 seconds, when the teenage daughter ignores her mother while focusing on her electronic device. This interaction is very typical among teenagers in Western cultures, particularly in the United States. In the United States, adolescents often begin questioning authority as teenagers. Many teenagers become very involved in their social lives, and this scene represents that well across cultures. An even deeper dynamic here is how the mother felt after this interaction; it's a pretty universal feeling that I'm sure parents of all different cultural backgrounds have felt.

Another scene that resonates with cultures universally is at 20 minutes 6 seconds in the second video, when the topic of dating and past relationships is drawn into the mix. A character receives a call from her ex-boyfriend during dinner; he is only seeking advice about his new relationship, but her current boyfriend is still not happy. This creates tension because the current boyfriend did not know that they were still in contact with each other. This moment captures a universally accepted dilemma: how past relationships can influence dating life.

Overall, I think the film truly serves the public well, and that by watching it, you begin to feel how similar we are rather than different (I think this is a strong underlying theme in the film). It made the film feel very real at times, and often I forgot I was even watching an international film, especially one set over 5000 miles from Florida.",99,"
Hi Daniel, this is a very strong essay. You've successfully identified the teenager's conflict with the parents as a key point of universality. Your analysis of the ex-boyfried call is also solid. Mechanically, you tend to repeat the phrase ""universally accepted"" or ""widely accepted."" Conflict isn't really ""accepted""; it is ""experienced"" or ""recognized."" A better phrase would be ""situations that are univesally recognizable."" "
2,"The film “Perfect Strangers” fits into many different cultural contexts, because its
central focus on trust, secrecy, and interpersonal relationships exhibits universal
aspects of human behavior that exist across the world. An example of this happens in
Video 2 at 22 min 51 seconds, where Rocco receives a phone call from his daughter.
During the phone call the daughter describes how her boyfriend wants them to have
sexual relations, and that she is scared and doesn’t want to do it, and so asks his dad
for advice. During this call she also disregards her mom, calling her a “silly cow”,
emphasizing how her mother would understand her in the same way Rocco does.
Showing how in the marriage there is clear trust in balance. Thus, the phone call
highlights how in all relationships, especially a marriage, there is bound to be conflict
when raising a kid. As two people may have different ways to educate their child in what
they see fit. Thus in the same video 24 min :21 seconds, it becomes particularly
revealing when Eva hears how her daughter describes her as uncaring. As in a
marriage the children are bound to tell some things to some parents or have a favorite
due to trust issues and ways to educate. As Eva has a more strict way of education, the
daughter perceives her as more judgmental. Whereas Rocco is less strict, seen giving
her money at the beginning of the film, as to why he is more trusted. This instance is
something that is global, as to why it's so easy for this to be replicated in Italian, English,
or German as is the case, as a child always can spark conflict in a marriage, and to why
this situation isn't exclusive to a country or language. For this reason, “Perfect
Strangers” exhibits universal applicability by centering on fundamental human conflicts,
such as trust, secrecy, and emotional distrust, that happen to exist in every country
regardless of language or location.",96,"
Hi Sebastian, you've chosen one of the most poignant scenes in the film to illustrate your point. And yes, no matter where you go in the world, parents struggle with this balance, and children often triangulate between them, as Sofia does here. 

For your next assignments, please double-check your citation. The film title is ""Perfect Secret,"" not ""Perfect Strangers."" Also, your essay contains several sentence fragments. You frequently start sentences with ""As"" or ""Thus"" but leave them incomplete. 

Overall, great work! "
2,"The part of this movie that I think is generally seen in most relationships occurs in video one at 42 minutes and 15 seconds. In this scene Bianca was receiving a call from someone, and the contact's name was Mouse, this was Bianca's friend from school Katja. When Katja called she was saying that she is finally getting back to Bianca's calls and starts talking about intimate issues between Bianca and her husband, she is talking about things that could be done to help with the intimacy that Katja has found helpful for her in her romantic relationship. The part I feel is connected to all relationships is the communication. Everyone needs to be able to talk to their people whether that be with your significant other or with a friend and even if it is to a friend about your significant other or even the other way around. If you are having problems, it can be extremely hard to deal with them on your own. Sometimes you may not be able to see everything that is going on or not know what would be helpful to do and a friend or partner might be able to assist you, or even if you just need someone to talk to so all the pressure is not just on you. Even though in the film Simon, Bianca's husband, did not like the idea of the call and hearing someone else talking about their intimacy issues, it could be very helpful advice for Bianca and if she goes through with the ideas it could be easier to understand and could more easily express these ideas to Simon which could actually benefit their relationship and could fix the problems they have been having. Being able to talk to people in all relationships is very important and is a key factor in relationships.",93,"
Hi Haley, 

You selected a compelling scene to illustrate a valid point: that external perspectives are often helpful to solve internal relationship issues. 

However, your essay contains several run-on sentences, including one over 50 words long, which makes it difficult to follow your thoughts.  Additionally, your main argument relies on abstract terms such as ""things,"" ""people,"" and ""problems."" To improve, you need to be more specific: What kind of problems are they facing? What specific strategies might the friend offer? Why exactly is it so hard to maintain objectivity on one's own? 

Overall, great job! "
2,"Although at its core Perfect Secret is a drama with some comedic elements and enough betrayal amongst
a friend group to make the viewers gasp, the film also touches on several major themes that support it
being translated into so many different languages, increasing accessibility to audiences. Perfect Secret
includes some very real and authentic themes, although in a dramatized manner, that most people can
relate with to a certain degree. Throughout the duration of the film there is a lot of backstabbing and
deceitfulness going on amongst the 7 main characters. However, a scene that stuck out to me as a positive
and raw representation of genuine friendship is in Video 2 at 41 minutes and 30 seconds. After finding
out that her fiancée has not only been sleeping with his colleague but also impregnated her, Bianca’s
character exits the room and goes to the bathroom, clearly distraught. The part that really sticks out to me
is directly after Bianca leaves the room, Carlotta pushes back from the table and sprints after her,
subsequently locks Simon out of the room, and comforts her. The highlight here is that Carlotta had just
been informed that her own husband had been having an affair as well, but in this exact moment she puts
that aside to be with her friend, prioritizing their relationship. This sequence of events has very little
dialogue as well, and I feel that no words being needed to understand this character interaction makes it
that much more diverse amongst the audiences and their cultures. The film encompasses other “real life”
topics such as Pepe’s character being revealed as a part of the LGBTQ+ community and the overall plot
subtly hinting at the detrimental harm that can be caused by abusing access to technology when combined
with disingenuous actions by individuals.",98,"
Hi Gwen, 

You've chosen a powerful scene to analyze. Your observation that Carlotta puts aside her own crisis to comfort her friend is a beautiful insight into the universal language of friendship. 

I have one suggestion for improvement. Your conclusion feels a bit rushed. You list major themes (""LGBTQ+ community,"" ""abusing technology"") at the very end without analyzing them. In the future, try to connect every theme you mention back to your main argument rather than listing them as an afterthought. 

Overall, great work! "
2,"I believe that the original film has so many different adaptations in different cultures throughout the world, because there are a lot of people who are disloyal or hide secrets from their partners. A lot of the character archetypes and problems that the characters in the movie have are shared with a lot of people in the real world. For example, just about everyone in the movie is a cheater. Even though everyone is basically in relationships and have romantic partners, none of them have been faithful to their partners, and even the one that kind of has, which is Bianca, honestly is way too friendly with her ex. I truly think that Bianca was a little dumb and naive and not the angel that she tries to portray herself to be. Another reason I think this movie has been adapted so many times is the drama that is in it. There are several points where a new problem or point of interest appears. One of them was when Pepe got outed as gay when he and Leo switch phones. This whole situation was filled with drama and conflict and made the movie more interesting. However, the primary point in the movie that I think had me the most interested started at 41:55 in the second portion of the movie when Eva slapped Simon and handed him the earrings that he apparently bought for her. This was such a big deal in the movie because of how much of a twist it was to find out the person in the movie who you felt bad for and seemed like a good person cheated on her husband with one of his best friends. Dramatic moments like this along with the fact that a lot of people out there are either cheaters or have been victims of their partners not being loyal to them are two reasons why movies like this are successful enough to get adapted so many times.",90,"
Hi Caleb, you correctly identified the film's reliance on dramatic conflict to drive the plot.

However, your argument relies on overgeneralizations. You stated that ""everyone in the movie is a cheater"" and implied this reflects the real world. Does everyone actually cheat? Rather than stating this as a fact, you should engage more deeply with your opinion: Is the film exaggerating to make a point, or is it exposing a hidden reality? Furthermore, regarding the dramatic element you analyzed, you did a good job describing the conflict. However, you didn't explain how that drama contributes to the film's universality. 

Finally, try to elevate your tone in future assignments; phrases like ""Bianca was a little dumb"" are too informal for academic writing. "
2,"I think that the topic/theme in this film is that trust is a big thing and also that not everything is what it seems. I think that the topic/theme fits into so many cultural contexts because cellphones are widely known as a privacy issue. With all of the secrets you can hide in a cellphone, its not common for this film to portray each different way. At 17:24 Eva says that ""its the black box of our lives"". I chose this quote because it shows that the cellphone is a universal object that is known by all people as something that holds everything in it, which is relevant to relationships in various cultural contexts. This film showed the difference in how each persons lives were portrayed as well as the difference in public vs private life's. It shows that secrets on a cellphone is a widely known thing and that its an ongoing issue in the world. This film had lots of twists and turns pertaining to relationships, especially at the end when they all became friends again and the situation with the second phone in the glovebox appeared. I think a situation in the film that is true for all relationships is that having trust is a very important thing in a relationship. When Eva explained to her husband that she was expecting to find something in his phone, her husband was explaining that even if something did appear for her, he would want to focus on the future. It showed that the therapy he was having really was helping him too. I think that this situation was the only real positive of the entire movie seeing that everything else was all very mentally unhealthy. I think the only other good person was Pepe, he was my favorite character because he wasn't hiding anything bad. He hid something personal to him and he wasn't too mad about it coming out, just how it did come out. Overall, I liked listening to this film and reading the English subtitles because I felt very engulfed into the language. ",92,"
Hi Kathryn, 

You selected excellent evidence with the ""Black Box"" quote, which perfectly captures the film's central metaphor. 

However, your essay shows abrupt shifts in flow. After you engaged with your first argument, you mentioned the twist about the ""second phone in the glovebox,"" but you didn't explain why this scene mattered. Then, you abruptly jumped to a new argument about trust. In academic writing, you need to connect your examples to your analysis/argument smoothly rather than listing them. 

Additionally, be careful with mechanical errors (e.g., use of possessive and plural markers) and imprecise vocabulary (using ""engulfed"" instead of ""immersed""). "
2,"After watching The Perfect Secret, one of the main themes that I feel carries over across cultures is that nothing stays a secret forever. The plot may frame it as a group of friends all having fun at a dinner party, but slowly, one by one, each person has something shared that they were keeping a secret (in most cases, it was a secret from their partners and also each other). They all try to bluff and avoid answering their phone at one point or try to avoid explaining the call/text/image they got but it never ends up working well for them. I think this is a perfect reflection of a lesson that most people within society could stand to learn. Keeping secrets from loved ones, be that friends, family, or partners, will never end up going the way you want it to. When you don't come clean about something and try to hide it, you are just delaying the inevitable fallout and quite likely worsening the reaction the other person involved will have. Also, in this movie multiple of the characters are cheating on. their partner, which I can never find an excuse for. Relationships of any kind, especially romantic ones, are built upon trust, putting your trust in someone in various scenarios, and letting them see you at your worst is one of the key components of a relationship. So when a person cheats, they are willingly going against everything that makes a relationship meaningful in a way that only serves to benefit them. A lot of cheaters will use the excuse that they didn't want to hurt the feelings of the person they were in a relationship with, when in actuality it is often because they are too emotionally immature to handle the emotions of another person and face them. ",75,"
Hi Shianne, 

You did a good job elaborating on your main argument regarding the movie's content. 

However, the essay reads more like a general opinion on the morality of cheating than a close analysis of the film. You did not reference a specific scene with a timestamp. You need to ground your arguments in concrete evidence (e.g., specific examples from real-world situations connected to the particular movie scene). "
2,"When I think about relationships, whether it be romantic or just platonic, I think about someone that is your ride or die, no matter what. Someone you never want to live your life without, and someone that can help support you with your shortcomings, and vice versa. I think that Pepe exhibits this line of thought in a perfect way in Perfect Secret. In the second video, at 3:10, Pepe is telling the story of how humans came to be. He says that people used to have round torsos, 2 heads, and 4 hands and feet. He says that Zeus, the ancient Greek God, wanted to weaken the people, so he cut them into two halves, resulting in what we look like today. Pepe goes on to finish the story by talking about how ""all our lives, we seek our other half that was violently torn from us,"" (3:25). This story I feel is a great example of how love and relationships really do not change, no matter the culture or time period, since it is a story by Plato from presumably thousands of years ago. A relationship is very much like that of a single organism that has 2 heads and 4 arms and legs, in the sense that you are always working towards the same goals (relatively), and you act as a tandem. Furthermore, I think the second point in the original story, about searching for our partner our whole lives, also rings true. When people are looking for a close relationship, they want someone who is their ""other half,"" in a sense. They want someone who has their best interests in mind, who makes up for their faults, and who unconditionally loves them. Plato and Pepe both demonstrate that love and relationships do not change much across cultures, in two wildly different time periods.",96,"
Hi Levi, 

You selected a beautiful and highly relevant scene to analyze. Your argument that this ancient Greek story proves the timeless, cross-cultural nature of the search for a soulmate is excellent. 

To take this analysis further, consider the irony of the scene. Pepe tells this story about wholeness, but he is hiding his true self and his other half from his friends at the same time. Additionally, the people at the table want to believe they have found their other halves, but the game shows they do not fully know their partners. The myth highlights the ideal, while the movie exposes the messy reality. Mentioning this contrast would have added significant depth to your essay. "
2,"The film The Perfect Secret tells the story of a group of friends that one night at dinner decide to play a game, that would soon reveal all of their secrets to each other. The film focuses on the theme that everyone has secrets, and that no matter how close people are to each other, they may be hiding something. The friends would soon find out that they do not know each other as well as they thought they did. Notifications, messages, and phone calls expose their lies, infidelity, and deepest secrets, creating tension and conflict among both romantic partners and longtime friends. The film is entertaining and easy to watch, it leaves the viewer craving more, trying to figure out whose secret is going to be exposed next, the producers were also clever to include some hints throughout the movie through dialogue, facial expressions, and actions, which makes the viewer also have to read between the lines. No matter where you are from, what language you speak, or your culture, the film speaks to you. It is relatable, it is captivating. The reason why the film has such universal applicability is because everyone can relate. As humans, we crave interaction, thrive in communities and groupa, we have the need to create bonds and relationships. However, as humans we also have many flaws, and therefore our relationships have many flaws too. We can know a person for years, yet not really know her. That is what the film depicts, it shows what we already know, that people have secrets, that people are always hiding something, that there is no way you can truly know someone. However, the film does it in an open way, in a way that leaves us wondering, what’s next? Something that is true for all relationship romantic or not is the shock of finding out someone is not who they appear to be, an example of that in the film is when they thought simon was having an affair with Hannes (video 2 31:55-32:45). This scene can represent what people feel when they discover another’s lies or secrets whether it is in a romantic relationship or a friendship-- the hurt, the confusion, the questioning.  The answer as to why the film has universal applicability lies within our nature. Human nature drives us to seek love, connection, and understanding, while at the same time protecting ourselves from judgment and vulnerability by hiding parts of who we are. This tension between closeness and secrecy is what shapes so many relationships, and it is exactly what the film exposes, making its story relatable, as the emotional conflict is human, not cultural.",92,"
Hi Brunna, 

You have a strong grasp of the film's central theme, and your analysis of human nature as the driver of the film's universal appeal is insightful. 

However, you confused Simon with Leo. In the scene you referenced, the group suspects Leo is having an affair with a man. Accurate character identification is essential. 

Additionally, watch out for grammar and typos. You have several run-on sentences and typos. 

Overall, great work! "
2,"At the beginning of the film, the audience is introduced to a close-knit group of friends who share
a strong bond. The group of boys were having a good time in nature without the impact/pressure of any
modern technology. As the film progresses, the viewers are introduced to the character’s personal lives,
which initially appear to be stable and ideal. Beneath the surface it becomes evident that each character is
hiding their own personal struggles in order to maintain the image of perfection in front of each other.
This theme of hidden truths is universally applicable because individuals across cultures often withhold
information to avoid judgement. One particularly universal theme explored in the film is the pressure to
make your life seem perfect through social media. When the characters are at the table together, the
character Leo admits that being a stay-at-home father is not as enjoyable as he portrays on Instagram.
Many people regardless of culture or age have the same desire to create this ideal life online.
A scene that shows the film’s relevance to all relationships occurs near the end, when Carlotta
breaks down and reveals that she does not want to be a working mother but instead would prefer staying
at home with her children (Video 3 at 20 seconds). The husband Leo had already explained that he would
prefer to return to work rather than staying at home and taking care of the children. Because neither
Carlotta or Leo properly communicates these feeling, resentment quickly builds. This lack of
communication ultimately led to serious consequences for their marriage. Some of these consequences
included infidelity and substance abuse. When people fail to communicate their needs and emotions, they
risk feeling unseen and misunderstood. Over time, these unmet needs can foster resentment and emotional
distance.",97,"
Hi Mila, 

You provided a clear central focus on the universality of hidden struggles, and your analysis of Leo and Carlotta's conflict regarding parenting roles effectively connects these themes to the broader pressure of social media. 

However, your essay is just under the minimum word count (298 words). Because of this brevity, the conclusion feels slightly rushed. To strengthen your argument, you could have expanded on the consequences you mentioned. 

Additionally, please review your grammar (see the comments attached to your submission). 

Overall, great work! "
2," The theme of The Perfect sense has reached many different cultural audiences because it focuses on shared human experiences. The film shows complexities behind people’s honesty and privacy. In most cultures, friendships and romantic relationships are built on trust, yet trust does not always mean complete transparency. Most people are still self-preserving in the sense of protecting themselves, avoiding conflict, and maintaining their image. These choices are not distinct to one culture, which explains how the film has reached global success and various adaptations.  

 

The film focuses on the central phone game. With using phones as the main focal point, individuals all over the world can relate to the shared use of a phone and the implications that may come with it. Phones are deeply personal objects world-wide that contain private conversations and personal memories many would not want to be shared. Although cultures have differing views on privacy, the fear of one’s life being personally exploited would is a common fear felt across most phone users. The film showcases this fear and the lengths that people would go to not have that fear get the best of them. Some going to drastic lengths to maintain that perfect facade, while some accept their exposed reality.  

 

For example, at 16:34 in the second clip of the movie, Simon reads a message from Bianca’s ex, which leads him to accuse Bianca of secretly still sleeping with her ex. Afterwards, to prove her innocence, Bianca calls him to make clear that they are only in contact to help her ex talk to women. This quarrel demonstrates a common fear that many couples no matter the culture: the fear of one not being good enough for their partner, causing one to cheat. Cheating scandals happen across the globe, and many couples have had to deal with the situation of being accused and clearing up their name like Bianca, or in Simon’s case, being accused and proven guilty. ",94,"Hi Jana,

You did a good job providing a solid analysis of the Bianca/Simon dynamic, correctly noting that jealousy often stems from a feeling of inadequacy. Your analysis of the Bianca/Simon scene is good, but you ended abruptly by saying Simon was ""proven guilty"" without explaining what he was guilty of (impregnating another woman). A quick clarification there would have solidified your point about the difference between Bianca's ""innocent"" secret and Simon's ""guilty"" one.

Also, you referred to the film as ""The Perfect Sense,"" which is a completely different movie; the correct title is The Perfect Secret.

Lastly, please pay attention to grammar and wording next time. Your phrasing is often confusing. For example, your sentence regarding ""the fear of one's life being personally exploited"" is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors (""would is"") and vague vocabulary. In the future, focus on refining your sentences to ensure your argument is clear and easy to read.

Overall, good work! "
2,"The Perfect Secret is a very relatable film, which is a huge reason why it has been
adapted into at least eighteen different languages. I believe most adults can relate to a situation in
which a game at a dinner party slowly gets out of hand. Many people feel uncomfortable when
someone else touches or looks at the notifications on their phone.
This is because phone calls, messages and pictures tend to hold private information and
personal secrets about the phone’s owner within them. Phones often contain things that people do
not want to be shared with the whole world, or are intentionally keeping from some. In the
movie, the idea is brought up that looking through the phone of a significant other can easily lead
to the end of a relationship (Video 1, 17:26). If someone finds out their partner is hiding things
from them on their phone, it leads to distrust and resentment that can’t always be fixed.
I think this idea is applicable to all romantic relationships. At some point, most people
have had the thought come to mind that someone’s loved one could be hiding something from
them on their cell phone. With the existence and evolution of dating apps and hidden browsers, it
can be easy for people to feel insecure about what their significant other is doing online. Since
technology is constantly advancing and the majority of adults own a smartphone or other
personal electronic device with internet access, the issue of people hiding things they are doing
on the internet from their loved ones is relatable to people all across the world.
This idea also does not just relate to romantic relationships. The same thing applies to
many different types of human connections, such as relatives and friends. Anyone could be
hiding something hurtful on their phone from someone in their life, and many people do hide

things on their phones from others. Since this is so common, most people have at least one
memory of discovering something someone they loved was doing online behind their back.
These acts of betrayal can range from saying something unkind to having secret affairs.
Regardless of the severity, finding out someone you love is intentionally doing something hurtful
and hiding it from you is a universal human experience.

Hi Grace,

You have written a smooth, relatable essay that clearly identifies the film's central premise about the anxiety surrounding digital privacy.

However, your analysis needs to be much more specific to the film itself. While you cited the timestamp (17:26) when the characters discuss the dangers of phones, you didn't identify who was speaking or the specific metaphor used (e.g., the phone as the ""black box"" of our lives). By relying on general terms like ""someone,"" ""significant other,"" and ""people,"" your essay reads more like a general commentary on smartphones than an analysis of The Perfect Secret.

To strengthen your essay, you can cite specific character names and distinct plot points.

Overall, good work!"
2,"The film focuses on the effect that social media/technology can have on friendships
or relationships. It displays how technology can encourage others to hide secrets
from people close to them. Even though the film focuses on this, the theme that first
caught my attention is regarding human connections and the emotions it can cause
like doubt or distrust. I think this theme fits into various cultural contexts because it
touches on human relationships, friendships and the doubt that can come from
them.
For example, in Video 26 minutes, 52 seconds there is a scene where the characters
talk about having kids. One of them, Carlotta, mentions that having kids was the best
thing that happened in her life. Meanwhile, another character, Pepe, mentioned that
he did not agree. He believed that two partners could find happiness and satisfaction
without having any kids. This scene shows the different perspectives that people have
within friend groups that can cause disagreements or arguments. Even though they all
share the same language, their ideas and values are drastically different for each
other which I think makes this film attractive to various cultures since it represents
that diversity.
In Addition to this, in Video 29, second 31 there is a scene where Pepe mentions him
looking for another job. The group of friends question his decisions due to their own
experiences with jobs. For example, one of the friends mentioned how their friend
would benefit from tenure at a school since it gives better insurance and better pay.
However, by changing his job the person gives up all those benefits that come from
tenure for a new job. This scene showed that within friendships people’s values and
life goals might not match each other. Even though later in the film it is revealed that
Pepe had other reasons for moving schools. I think this can be true for all friendships,
even if they are the same age and speak the same language they can be in different
stages of life and hiding that from each other in fear of judgement. Just like he did by
saying he wasn’t interested in the job during the phone call, however his actions of
sending in various applications show otherwise.
This fear is a normal human emotion that comes from social interactions and close
relationships, which is why I think people can relate to this film so much. Therefore,
people from different countries and cultural context can relate to this film because it",95,"Hi Elena, great job on this.

You moved beyond the obvious theme of ""cheating"" to explore a subtler one: peer pressure and the fear of judgment. Specifically, your analysis of Pepe's job situation perfectly supports your argument.

For your next assignments, try to tighten your phrasing to stay within the 300-400-word range. Additionally, please double-check your grammar and typo errors (I've left comments on your submitted work).

Overall, great job!"
2,"The topic showed universal appeal when the group of friends began playing the game
called “Coming Clean.” The idea is introduced at 19:20 and by 19:40 everyone agrees to play,
thinking it’s just going to be harmless fun. This moment of realization is relatable across all
cultures because it shows how people might agree to something without fully realizing the
emotional weight it can carry. At first, the friends treat the game as a joke, confident that they
have nothing to hide from one another. This reaction is very common, most people assume that
being close to someone means that they already know everything about them. However, the
tension that immediately follows shows a truth that applies to almost all types of relationships:
everyone has private thoughts, conversations, or experiences they don’t really want to share,
even with people that they love. The discomfort around placing phones on the table indicates
how personal smartphones have become part of our everyday lives. No matter the culture,
phones hold messages, secrets, and versions of ourselves that we don’t always want exposed.
This scene feels very right for both friendships and romantic relationships because it shows that
secrecy is not always about lying, but about protecting yourself or others. Your friends may fear
being judged, while romantic partners may worry about hurting someone or creating an issue.
The nervous laugh and hesitation when the group agrees to the game captures a feeling most
people recognize, the fear of fully being seen. These emotions are so common that I don’t think
they are tied to any specific culture, this scene works just as well as in different countries and
social settings. Overall, the “Coming Clean” game shows that trust in relationships doesn’t
always mean total honesty, and that balance between openness and privacy is something people
struggle with everywhere.",98,"
Hi Mirel, 

You provided a thoughtful analysis of the ""Coming Clean"" game. Your insight that secrecy is often about protection rather than just lying is excellent. One thing: double-check your grammar (see attached comments on your submitted work).

Overall, great job"
2,"The film The Perfect Secret is all about a friend group that is interacting at dinner and
plays a game that experiments with social boundaries and trust on their personal phones. This
applies across many cultures because almost everyone today uses a smartphone as part of daily
life and tends to protect their own privacy. This makes the main idea of the movie something that
people from many countries and cultures can relate to. No matter the culture, people experience
similar embarrassment between wanting privacy or personal space regardless of how close they
are with a person..
One scene that clearly shows this universal theme happens early in the film when the
group is deciding whether to play the phone game (Video 1 at about 20 minutes). At this point,
everyone hesitates while trying to seem calm and confident. They joke with one another and
tease each other, but it is clear that a couple of them feel uncomfortable. This moment reflects
how real groups of friends often behave when something serious or uncomfortable is brought up.
People try to hide their nervousness with humor, and they say things that are bold or sarcastic to
avoid showing fear or insecurity. The scene is very entertaining to me, but it also feels realistic
because it shows how people react when their privacy is threatened. I personally would react
similarly if I were hiding something or resisting exposing my secrets.
This moment is especially true for relationships and friendships because it shows how
people may act like they have nothing to hide while still feeling worried about what might be
revealed. I comfortably hand my phone to my partner because I don't have anything to hide yet
there is always that thought in the back of my mind that what if something crazy comes up.
Some characters resist the game at first but then insist that their partner participate, even though
they pretend not to care. This shows how trust and jealousy can exist at the same time in
relationships.",96,"
Hi Matteo, 

You provided a relatable analysis of the film's premise. You also made a great point about the paradox of the innocent person still feeling anxiety about their phone being checked. It is indeed universal! 

Your essay would be much stronger if you used specific character names. Instead of saying ""a couple of them feel uncomfortable"" or ""some characters,"" identify them (e.g., Leo's reluctance vs. Bianca's eagerness). 

Additionally, proofread for punctuation. You had a few run-on sentences where commas were needed and typos like double periods at the end of a sentence (see the comments I've attached to your submission).

2,"The film “The Perfect Secret” has been successfully remade in different languages
because of its universal theme: privacy and transparency in close relationships create
tension. Regardless of culture, people hold multiple identities because there is a
difference between appearance and reality. For example, couples and friends may present
themselves as happy, loyal, and open, but the messages and calls on their phones reveal
something different such as emotional distance, infidelity, jealousy, and unspoken
resentment. Romantic partners and close friends everywhere experience jealousy,
insecurity, and fear of judgement and mostly, if not all, people hold secrets.
Early in the film, in video 1, at approximately 18 minutes, Eva proposes a game where
everyone must place their phone on the table and share all incoming messages and calls
aloud. Starting here is when things started to get tense as confidential information was
revealed. This scene also sets up the fact that our phones are personal objects, containing
secrets that we may not share with our close friends and romantic partners. To elaborate
more, in Video 1, at about 41:50, Carlotta receives a phone call from her best friend,
Mouse. In this call, it was revealed that Carlotta is not satisfied with her and her
husband’s, Leo, sex life, uncovering neglect and dissatisfaction. Many relationships across
the world struggle with not only betrayal, but with silence and withdrawal.
Another example in the film starts in Video 2, at approximately 32 minutes and 31
seconds. In this scene, it was revealed that Leo (really Pepe), received a text from Hannes
that stated, “I miss your kisses.” Simon became upset with Leo saying that Simon should
have told him he was gay so he can decide if it suits him. This made Leo mad and because
of that he told Simon, “The misunderstanding is thinking we’re friends.” This moment
demonstrated how certain truths about oneself can ruin friendships and/or relationships.
Pepe, the true homosexual, was afraid to tell his friends he was into guys because of his
fear of being judged, demonstrating that people often keep secrets to protect their
relationships with others.",97,"Hi Ta'Niyah, 

You provided a strong analysis of the film's universal themes. Your discussion of the Leo/Pepe phone swap is particularly good; you correctly identified that Simon's reaction reveals the fragility of their relationship. 

However, your essay finishes a bit abruptly. After explaining Pepe's situation, the essay simply stops. It would be great if you concluded your essay with final sentences that summarize your thoughts and tie these specific examples back to the central theme of the film.

2,"I found the film The Perfect Secret very interesting. Particularly the way the film was
structured around the dinner table after the prologue. The first 20 or so minutes of the film really
helped set the characters and the main premise of the movie. I have not really watched a movie
where it was predominantly dialogue like this, and very focused on just one setting, the dinner
table. The concept of having everyone’s phones on display at the table throughout the night was
really entertaining. It really showed how modern technology has really changed relationship
dynamics. Phones and really technology in general has really affected how people interact with
each other, specifically the accessibility 3everyone has to each other. This change is really
amplified in relationships, as most of the issues couples have are consistent, disregarding
cultures, languages, and nationality. Problems such as infidelity, trust issues, and money have
always plagued relationships. In the second video at 21:50 Bibi talks about how she won’t call
her ex-boyfriend anymore if it makes her new boyfriend uncomfortable. She reassures Simon
that she likes him and that she won’t call her ex anymore. Eva says that Bibi would continue
calling him secretly, Bibi responds she would not call him anymore and that since she said so she
wouldn’t. Eva says it’s absurd since they’re still friends and they should be able to keep in touch.
It is then said that Simon just needs to trust Bibi. This interaction highlights the difficulty of
trusting your partner, and the way insecurities will always arise in relationships. The main topic I
want to highlight here is the issue of trust, which has universal applicability and is at the root of this conflict. Simon does not trust Bibi fully since she is still in contact with her ex-boyfriend
which many would say is strange and maybe even unacceptable. The issue of trust seems to be so
applicable because as a core human principle we want to be able to trust our friends, family, and
significant other. If you cannot trust someone, how will you ever be able to be comfortable with
them, or even love them? Overall, trust will always be a core theme that regardless of language
will always be one of the most valuable things humans can have with one another.

Hi Daniel,

You provided a great observation about the film's structure. Your analysis of the Bianca/Simon conflict is also solid.

2,"The theme of the film ""Perfect Secret"" works in various cultural contexts primarily due to the fact that it is not specifically centered around a particular culture, rather it is focused on human beings and their behavior in general. The main theme is how people deal with pressure and how it affects relationships, and this theme is taken across all of the film's variants. While the environment and language change in each adaptation, the central theme remains the same. For instance, the pressure that each character faces during the film is not something that only Germans experience. Instead, it is something that human beings in general experience in their lives. Specifically, (starting at 2:50 in Video 3) the scene were Pepe officially comes out as homosexual to the group can be used as a demonstration of this. For years Pepe has felt the pressure of not fully understanding who he was as a person and after all of this time has decided to openly share this information with the group. This pressure that Pepe felt is not something that specifically comes from the film's German culture, but instead the emotions that we as people face. He mentioned his fear of having to come out in front of a court if he were to have called the police on the man harassing him. Pepe had a reason to hide his true self from everyone, as he was scared of the idea that he would be shunned for being the way he is. He even ended up finding out how his friends felt about the idea of someone being homosexual that night, which pushed him away from the idea of coming out even further. Every society has different reasons for people to hide elements of themselves. The specific reasons change but the emotional aspect that humans deal with is universal and does not.",99,"
Hi Nicholas, 

Your analysis of Pepe's specific dilemma is insightful and accurate to the plot. You correctly identified that his fear is about societal judgment, which is indeed a universal human experience. 

For your next assignments, please proofread for typos (e.g., ""the scene were Pepe..."" should be ""the scene where Pepe..."") and appropriate use of commas. (e.g., ""For years,"" ""...as a person, and after all of this time, has...""). "
2,"The German adaptation, The Perfect Secret, of the Italian film, Perfetti Sconosciti, is
depicts a group of lifelong friends that have dinner together and uncover secrets that their
phones have managed to keep hidden. It discusses themes of infidelity, gender roles, and
sexuality to display to the audience that honesty in relationships of this day and age is what
keeps them alive.
From the beginning of the film, not a single character can muster honesty, and the
film introduces the audience to this immediately with messages from secret lovers, crude
photos, and intense phone calls. The characters cannot face the realities, facilitated by
their devices, that they have built for themselves. All the characters face a lack of
satisfaction in their marriages, physically and/or emotionally. For example, Carlotta’s
phone call with her best friend, who she calls Mouse, reveals that she is not satisfied with
thre intimate life between her husband and her (The Perfect Secret Video 1, 42 min 27
seconds). However, Leo acts embarrassed and surprised by this. This example portrays
the lack of communication between those in the relationships and how instead of
confronting these problems and talking about it, they used their devices to find outlets.
Shortly before Carlotta’s call with Mouse, Leo reveals to Pepe that he receives photos from
a young woman every night at 9:00pm (The Perfect Secret Video 1, 39 min 38 seconds).
Additionally, Leo mentions to Rocco that he hates being a stay-at-home father but is afraid
to tell Carlotta in fear she’ll be angry with him. Later in the movie, despite Leo’s beliefs,
Carlotta mentions that she hates being a working mother. The problems in their intimate
life rooted from the fact that they were not honest with each other about the different
aspects of their lives that were dissatisfying them.
This topic seems to be so universally applicable because technology and its
mannerisms have reached the entire globe. It has created something for people to hide
behind, and so instead of addressing problems as they arise, people turn to their phones
and find a distraction. It is the result of devices that takes away the need for accountability.
The couples in the film are a depiction of this, as most of them had managed to keep secret
affairs hidden until they all decided to share what was on their devices.",98,"
Hi Sophie, this is a fantastic analysis of the Leo and Carlotta dynamic. This miscommunication is indeed universally applicable. 

For your next assignments, just be careful with grammatical errors and typos. "
2,"I think the topic/themes of The Perfect Secret have such universal applicability because it explores many kinds of modern relationships that recent generations have had to navigate through. One in particular that caught my interest was the relationship between Eva and Leo. The thought of a working mother and a stay-at-home father is becoming increasingly common. However, despite its widespread presence, this dynamic is often harshly judged and criticized by those outside it. Fathers are belittled and emasculated because they are not financially supporting their families. Mothers are judged by their absence in their children's development. In Video 1 at 3 min 30 seconds, Leo's mother makes judgmental comments about Eva, pointing out that her children did not seem to miss her while she was at work. However harsh and realistic that scene may be, I mainly focused on the internal struggle Eva later explained in the film. In Video 3 at 23 seconds, Eva finally explodes, unleashing her anger and frustration with her situation. She explains that she wishes she could be a traditional housewife, able to spend time with her children and be a witness to their monumental 'firsts'. She explains her anger with her toxic, male-centered work environment, and yet admits she finds any kind of time taken away to be with her children as ""self-serving"". This internal struggle is a plight many working mothers face. Although society is advancing rapidly and the reality of women earning higher pay than their male counterparts is becoming more common, many women still struggle to balance their need to support their families with their desire to raise their children. Showcasing topics like this, in my opinion, has led to this movie becoming an international success, as evidenced by the many adaptations from around the world.",96,"Hi Mia, 

You have written a very thoughtful analysis of the ""working mother"" dilemma. Your observation that society judges both working moms and domestic dads is excellent. 

However, you have confused the characters. The character you are describing is Carlotta, not Eva. (Eva is the hostess/therapist married to Rocco). Additionally, your essay is under the word count limit. For future assignments, try to expand your discussion to meet the length requirements. 

Overall, great job! "
2,"The Perfect Secret film had a simple storyline set mainly in one location, yet it was able to uniquely explore the idea that truth is often concealed. This topic has universal applicability, as secrecy and pride are natural reflections of human society and its imperfections. As a society, we often lie and hide the truth, frequently from the people closest to us, in order to protect ourselves from feelings of guilt, embarrassment, or failure. There were many instances in the film where relationships became exposed and ultimately ended. This film explores relationships between family members, romantic partners, and friends, showcasing how each one is equally challenged when confronted with hidden truths and introspection. For instance, at 34 minutes and 33 seconds in the second video, Simon wrongly finds out that his best friend, Leo, is gay. Feeling betrayed and uninformed, he says, “I want to know if my friend’s gay so I can decide if it suits me.” This scene reflects the cultural aspect of sexual orientation and acceptance, as Simon reacts negatively to this news and changes his perception of Leo and their friendship. Another example is depicted in the second video between Simon and Bianca, as Simon attempts to conceal his infidelity with a coworker. At 41 minutes and 10 seconds, Bianca answers his phone and hears a women say, “I’m in the bathroom, and the test has two lines…I think I’m pregnant.” This brief phone call revealed the truth about their relationship, eroding all possibilities of a future together. These examples demonstrate the film’s universal applicability, as they center on secrets, trust, and fear. Every culture values connection, yet every culture also struggles with honesty and sincerity. The dinner table phone game works as a universal metaphor. As phones become a storage center for private thoughts, unspoken desires, and emotional truths meant to remain confidential. however, as the game unfolds, these secrets are exposed, revealing withheld information that had sustained many relationships.",98,"
Hi Katarzyna, 

You demonstrated excellent attention to detail regarding the plot. Your analysis of Simon's infidelity scene is also excellent. 

For your next assignments, watch out for grammar (e.g., ""...and hears a women say"" should be ""...and hears a woman say.""), capitalization ('however' in your final sentence).

2,"The German adaptation of Perfetti Sconosciuti, an Italian film, is Perfect Stranger, where a simple dinner party escalates quickly. The film is simple yet contains a theme that is prominent due to its relevance. When the seven friends place their cell phones in the center of the dinner table, they exchange their calls and texts to the group to attest loyalty in both their romantic relationships and friendships. 

The theme of the German film is a negative representation of modern society’s method of communication, where hiding their lives behind a screen is preferred to sharing intimate information personally to close ones- which may compromise many’s own relationships. 

An example in the film, Perfect Stranger, of the theme is when Pepe conceals he is gay from the group. Instead of bringing his romantic partner, he decides to hide it. When Pepe finally reveals this secret that he has been hiding, the theme is expressed. The scene is a representation of the discomfort often experienced when our choices are revealed and judged. 

Pepe is a prime example of hiding behind a screen instead of expressing himself to his closest friends. At approximately 2 minutes and 50 seconds into the third video, Pepe finally reveals that he is the one that is the true homosexual in the group of friends and lovers. Rather than being honest, concealing the secret introduced a lot of conflict between multiple people. Once Pepe decided to tell the dinner party the truth, they all embraced him for what he was rather than kicking him out of the group for his preferences. If Pepe had informed the group his true situation, the friends and their partners would have not only reduced more future conflict, but they would have also accepted Pepe sooner. Pepe most likely hid this for the duration of the film due to the fear of being criticized. This is an accurate representation of people’s expressions being hindered due to poor communication we experience with the influence of social media and phones.

In conclusion, Perfect Stranger is an accurate adaptation of smartphones' effect on modern communication. The film introduces the idea that people should be more comfortable in sharing information about themselves to those who are closest rather than hiding behind lies or smartphones. Less problematic communication may result with more directness.",94,"
Hi Ryan, you've correctly identified the fear of judgment as the universal engine driving this film. 

However, regarding the title of the film, you refer to it as ""Perfect Stranger."" While the original Italian film is called Perfetti Sconosciuti (""Perfect Strangers""), the German adaptation you watched is titled The Perfect Secret.

Additionally, your interpretation that the friends ""accepted Pepe sooner"" and ""all embraced him"" does not capture the full tension. In the film, some friends (like the taxi driver) struggle with deep-seated homophobia before coming around. 

Lastly, double-check for phrasing like ""...compromise many's own relationships."" It is better to write ""many people's relationships."" "
2,"The themes of secrets and lies is widely universal, and the film The Perfect Secret perfectly encapsulates the idea that everyone has something to hide. This film comedically captures the essence of what it means to be human - what it means to be imperfect. Relationships are ruined and friendships tested when the 4 lifelong friends and 3 of their wives come together for a dinner party and read each other's messages and calls. Peculiarly, despite the mistakes made and secrets kept, most of them remain friends afterwards. Rocco, whose friends discovered his second phone after being the only person at the dinner party not exposed for cheating, says it best in Video 3 at 15 min and 59 seconds: ""We learned that none of us is better than the other.""

In the context of relationships and friendships, this forced transparency can be a double-edged sword. By the end of the film, one couple has broken up due to the intense game, but prior to the party, they appeared to be the most affectionate, passionate, and ""in love."" Their relationship, however, was not able to withstand the secrets they kept and lies they told one another. This demonstrates the destructive power of honesty to a fault and questions how well we may really know those that are closest to us. Dishonesty, secrecy, and deceit is something many people and relationships struggle with making this aspect of the movie highly relatable to many across the world. 

On the other hand, this level of honesty and exposure also has the power to strengthen relationships. For example, Rocco, Leo, Simon, and Pepe went on a lighthearted and carefree trip together after the events of the dinner party, remarking that they're glad they ""patched things up again"" (video 3 at 15 minutes and 37 seconds). This contrasts Simon and Bianca's relationship by implying the boys' friendships have actually gotten stronger. In this case, the exposure of secrets and wrongdoings increased trust in their friendship by clearing up misunderstandings, such as Pepe's coming out, and understanding that they are not perfect.  ",98,"
Hi Julianna, 

You provided a well-written analysis of the ""double-edged sword"" of honesty. Your observation that the ""perfect"" couple falls apart while others survive is a great point about the fragility of perceived perfection. 

For your next assignments, please proofread for: 

Subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""The themes of secrets and lies are widely universal..."")
Verb (e.g., ""Relationships are ruined and friendships are tested..."")
Correct article usage (e.g., ""...they kept and the lies..."") 
Punctuation (e.g., ""...and relationships struggle with, making this..."") 
Overall, good work! "
2,"After watching the German adaptation of the film “Perfetti Sconosciuti”, I think that the themes apply to so many cultures because, despite our cultural differences, we all have complex relationships with our family, friends, and romantic partners. In any culture, no relationship is exempt from secrets, lies, difficult conversations, conflict, and vulnerability. The movie does a great job at portraying how difficult truth and vulnerability can be in relationships and how easy it is to fall into monotony with your partner and friends. For example, in the movie, Pepe kept his sexuality a secret from his friends because he was afraid of not being accepted. Leo and Carlotta also struggle with being honest with each other about how unhappy they are. Carlotta desires to be at home with her kids, while Leo is tired of being on paternity leave and is also being unfaithful to Carlotta. They both have desires but lack honest communication with one another that would help them overcome this conflict and meet each other's needs. 

This movie reminds me of many English films in the U.S. where couples face infidelity, monotony, and conflicts similar to what the couples experienced in this movie. Many cultures experience common themes regarding partnerships, and differences in language and culture do not mean that there aren’t similarities in our romantic partnerships and friendships.

In the film, something true for all relationships was the conversation between Rocco and his daughter Sophie. In the scene, Sophie asks her father not to tell her mother, Eva, that she is actually going to her boyfriend's house. Still, Rocco asks Sophie to give her mom the chance and tell her the truth (Video 2 at 24 min and 25 seconds). For all relationships, you would think the truth would make things easier. Still, we also know how it can hurt others, yet the truth could save us from the pain of lying to ourselves and others. The truth can also be the key to creating stronger relationships. All the couples in this movie would have better communication and relationships with their partners if they were initially honest about how they felt and their emotional needs. This is what makes the scene particularly powerful and true for all relationships.",98,"
Hi Alejandra, you've correctly identified that the film's universality stems from the universal struggle of vulnerability. You did a great job summarizing the Leo and Carlotta dynamic and analyzing the Rocco and Sophie scene. 

Your paragraph comparing the film to ""English films in the U.S."" could be stronger by mentioning why American films might tackle this similarly or differently. "
2,"8:43

I believe the general topics you see in the film such as friendships and relationships are not uncommon. In fact, I would say that each of these relationships - whether with friends or couples - are relationships that are seen in all regions, not being divided by something as trivial as language. Humans have tendencies - at least some humans - and habits that are not tied or tethered to language. A good amount of humans react similarly in multiple situations. While it may be obvious that if near any human say a crazy person with a gun or a giant rolling boulder coming at them, they would run, there are smaller actions that they tend to exhibit or do in response to situations or actions seen. While languages and culture may differ either by a small margin or a giant leap, there are still general concepts that stick with all humans. For an example relating to the film - humans start relationships. They find someone that they fall in love with, and they get with them one way or another - whether it be marriage or any other ceremony. This is a constant. Something that is seen in all regions throughout all languages. What is also seen throughout all regions and languages is the grueling fact that lust and temptation may overcome some individuals, leading to affairs and betrayal withing these relationships. While these are very big topics, and points of tension throughout the film, I want to focus on the friendships and relationship's introductions during the beginning of the film. Starting at 8:43. Here we see - now how the friendship was build - but how it interacts. Not only do we get to see this friendship interacting - but we get to see it after years of existence. This friendship is one that I can at least say I have seen within my own culture and plays a very general friendship related throughout many cultures. This is seen on a deeper aspect around the 22 minute mark as we see them become more personal throughout the rest of the film - while staying relatable and grounded.",90,"
Hi Christian, 

You identified the broad themes of friendship and betrayal. 

However, this essay is far too generic. You did not name a single character or describe a specific plot point in detail. To improve, you need to ground your analysis in the movie: Who is betraying whom? What specific dialogue at 8:43 shows their friendship? 

Additionally, please proofread the following areas: 

Punctuation (e.g., ""...you see in the film, such as friendships and relationships, are not uncommon."")
Subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""...whether with friends or couples - is a relationship that is seen in...""
Wording (e.g., ""A good number of humans..."")
Article (e.g., ""For example"" not ""For an example"") 
Spelling (e.g., ""withing these relationships."")
Verb form (e.g., ""...now how the friendship was built..."")"
2,"The themes central to The Perfect Secret apply to all cultures across the world,
making it easy to successfully produce the film in a variety of languages. The Perfect
Secret relies on love and lust to set the conflict of the film. Many of the characters have
to contend with their love for their significant others and the lust they feel for their affair
partners. Love is a universal language, one that can be experienced by anyone regardless
of background, culture, and lived experiences. However, love and commitment to
another person are not always enough to feel fulfilled. Many experience the desire to
have another person, sexually or otherwise, even though they may feel dedicated to their
legitimate partner. Love and lust are found in all cultures, from the extremely
conservative to the sexually liberated. Whether a relationship is born out of love or lust,
there is a commonality that links all relationships, romantic or platonic: the desire not
to hurt the one you love.
At minute 39:50, Leo desperately attempts to convince Pepe to switch phones
with him, so any incriminating evidence of his affair would be assumed to be Pepe’s. Leo
knows his affair is wrong, but ultimately, he doesn’t want to hurt his wife by making her
think she is not enough. This is emphasized when, later in the film, at minute 76:62,
while everyone still presumes Leo to be gay, he reveals half-truths about his affair to
Carlotta. He could’ve denied the affair or revealed the truth about the phone switching,
but he chose to tell her about it, in his own way, because he can see that the truth would
hurt her less than his deceit. Leo’s need to cause the least amount of harm to Carlotta
prompts him to stop concealing his affair, which he had previously thought was the best
way not to hurt her. In fact, all characters that have affairs in this film try to conceal
them because ultimately, they don’t want their partners to suffer because of their
actions. Loving someone, romantically, platonically, comes with a deep-seated need not
to cause them any pain, and this is true for all people regardless of culture, as it was true
for all the characters regardless of their backgrounds.

2,"The theme of the film ""The Perfect Secret"" is a universal concept since it's rooted in human experiences that people unfortunately go or went through. Precisely, it's the dynamic of moral respect, accountability, trust, and secrecy within relationships. No matter the diversity of the world or groups of people in society, people despise the feeling of tension between one another, especially when revealing a harsh truth that could potentially risk damage in a relationship or social standpoint. A scene from the film that captures the theme is every moment the room falls silent, for even a second, when a phone rings, and they're exposing what's on another's phone. For instance, when Pepe's phone received a notification and it was an explicit gif, he sat silently for a while, until he finally let the truth be revealed through the tension he was feeling in his chest.(Video 3: 2 mintues amd 50 seconds). For a moment, it seemed that the silence felt safer than the truth, yet the emotional weight of the truth and throwing his friend under his bus became unbearable. Though the certain scene is mainly for film, the emotional conflict is recognized worldwide. His initial hesitaion, fear of judgement, and his concerns of how his friend will view him is viewed a real-life dilemma that society goes through. It captures, therefore, the universal struggle of choosing peace rather than the cost of deception. Ultimately, the film reflects on any relationship, whether it be a friendship or between lovers, the question of whether it's better to protects others from the painful truth or respect them by keeping it a secret. This question allows anyone in their own little worlds to reflect on their own experiences. It's a broad theme that I believe should always be raised when regarding anyone an indivisual may love.",94,"
Hi Golden, 

You provided a thoughtful reflection on the tension between peace and truth. Your observation that ""silence felt safer than the truth"" is a poignant summary of the characters' motivations. 

However, your analysis of the Pepe/Leo scene is confusing. Because of the phone swap, it is crucial to clarify who is holding the phone and who receives the message. Being precise about these details is important. 

Additionally, please proofread your work before submitting; there were several typos (e.g., ""hesitaion,"" instead of ""hesitation"") and grammar issues (e.g., ""..and his concerns of how..."" instead of ""...and his concerns about how his..."")."
2,"The reason the topic of the film Perfect Secret has such universal applicability is that it
revolves around an aspect of life that most humans in all cultures engage in, which is the use of
phones as a container of our lives. As mentioned in the film, phones in today’s age work as the
“black box” of our lives. We store our locations, pictures, messages, phone calls, contacts, and
other types of media that, in a way, can highlight our real selves (Video 1 at 17 min 20 seconds).
The concept of having to be completely open with your phone with both your friends and
partners essentially implies opening oneself to be fully transparent and allowing your deepest
and darkest secrets to come out into the light. And since most of humanity, in some capacity,
has access to a phone or some sort of technological object for information storage, like a
computer, this concept can be established in a film surrounding most cultures in the world and
serve the exact same purpose, to reveal yourself to others. In terms of how this interacts with
both partners and friends, it is also highly, but also sadly, universal across many cultures around
the world. As things can be taken out of context, similar to how everyone thought Pepe was
dating a really young girl (Video 2 at 10 min 10 seconds), or how everyone thought Leo was gay
despite being married to a girl (Video 2 at 29 min 35 seconds), or when the truth about a mistress
comes out like it did multiple times with Simon. Showing how a lot of the time we use our
phones to hide the parts of us we don’t want anyone, even our loved ones, to see, since it would
change their whole view of you as a person",93,"
Hi Sebastian, you've correctly identified the film's central metaphor: the smartphone as the ""Black Box"" of our lives. Your argument that this is universal is solid as well. 

For your next assignments, focus on the following areas: 

Sentence fragments: Some of your sentences miss a main subject or verb, or are just dependent clauses left hanging. For example, your final sentence is a fragment without a main verb.

2,"You never really know somebody until you know what they’re hiding. People carry so
much of their private lives right in their hand or their pockets and it goes unnoticed. The theme
of The Perfect Secret shows in a universally applicable way, transcending language, culture, and
social norms this very thing. Vulnerability exists in all societies as well as secrecy, jealousy,
trust, and even fear although relationships expectations culturally vary. Today, nearly everyone
has some sort of a smartphone or device. These devices act as an extension for somebody’s
personal identity. No matter where the story is set it’s an unsettling feeling thinking about the
exposition of ones calls and messages, or whatever else they’re hiding on their phone. This is
exactly how this film is successfully adapted to so many cultures.
Close friends and partners don’t receive the full version of someone; they receive a
curated version of that person. The dinner game exposes characters to bridge the gap between
their public and private lives. Constant digital communication is a global reality today however
and is not specific to German or Italian cultures. It’s normal and relatable to feel anxieties about
being judged, abandoned, or even misunderstood because of the thoughts or actions hidden in
your private life. In the film there is one scene specifically that I think is true for all relationships
is when Leo starts receiving awfully suspicious messages on his phone during the phone game
which leads Bianca to question Leo’s honesty (Video 2 at about 38 minutes). Bianca’s behavior
shifts before the truth is revealed. It shows how quickly trust can shift and begin to melt away
when there’s secrecy between people, in a relationship or a friendship. This is a modern
universal experience, you feel betrayed and imagine things to fill the gaps, the uncertainty feels
like its eating you alive causing emotional damage. Doubt spirals so quickly when there is no
clear communication or it feels incomplete.
I also think a relatable aspect in this film is the test of friendships once the private hidden
information becomes public. When secrets emerge, group dynamics change, and doubt spirals
within a group. Relationships romantic and platonic both heavily rely on mutual respect and
boundaries. Defensiveness and discomfort displayed through the characters in this film
demonstrate real reactions once there is a threat on personal privacy.
Overall, the film reflects modern romantic and platonic relationship struggles with an
increase in technology that resonates across many cultures. It makes you wonder, relationships
are built on truth and trust but how much truth can those relationships really survive?
",92,"
Hi Lainey, 

You provided a strong psychological insight: that our friends receive a ""curated version"" of us, while our phones hold the truth. This is an excellent point that captures the film's essence. 

However, your essay is 431 words, which exceeds the 300-400 word limit. Next time, try to edit town your body paragraphs to stay within the range.

Overall, great work! "
2,"After watching the movie Perfect Secret, I came to the conclusion that the overall theme of
the film was the universal tendency to hide secrets from society, even when that secrecy extends
to one’s closest friends or romantic partners. The widespread adaptability of the film across
cultures can be explained by its focus on emotions and behaviors that are not culturally specific
but fundamentally human. Concepts such as fear of judgment, desire for privacy, jealousy,
temptation, and the need to maintain social “peace” were all touched upon. In Perfect Secret, the
smartphones of the characters function almost as containers for desires and decisions that they
carefully curated and/or concealed, a phenomenon that truly goes beyond national and cultural
boundaries in this day and age. Since societies now rely on personal technology such as these
smartphones, the tension created by forced transparency of the party feels immediately relatable
regardless of language or cultural norms. A particularly universal scene occurs during the dinner
game when private messages and phone calls begin revealing contradictions between how the
characters present themselves and who they truly are, especially within romantic relationships.
When flirtatious and intimate messages with third parties are exposed, such as the one between
Leo and Hannes (Video 2 at 32 minutes and 30 seconds), the result shows a truth that applies
broadly to many people. Trust in relationships is often built on partial knowledge rather than
complete honesty. The reactions of the characters, like their denial, defensiveness,
embarrassment, and emotional withdrawal, clearly mirror responses commonly seen in real life
conflicts across all cultures. Furthermore, the dynamic among this group of friends illustrates
that friendships, like romantic relationships, also often rely on unspoken agreements about what
is better left unsaid. The film does not argue that secrecy is inherently immoral, but instead it
raises the question of whether total transparency is even desirable or sustainable in the first place.
This allows audiences from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds to engage with the story
without feeling that it imposes one single value system. Overall, Perfect Secret achieves its
universal appeal by combining interpersonal dilemmas with modern technology, and by doing so
shows how love and self protection collide in ways that are recognizable in virtually any cultural
context.",98,"
Hi Liliana, 

You provided an excellent analysis of the film's central question, and your argument about how technology acts as a ""container for desires"" is insightful. 

One thing: be precise with plot details. The messages from Hannes were intended for Pepe. Leo was merely holding Pepe's phone due to the swap. Clarifying this important plot is crucial for accurate analysis and backing up your argument. 

Overall, great work! "
2,"I think The Perfect Secret is very relatable, especially in terms of relationships. In the
film, some characters are completely comfortable sharing their phones with the group, while
others are hesitant or secretive. This situation captures a universal tension in both romantic
relationships and friendships: the balance between trust and privacy. Everyone is hanging out,
having fun, and drinking, but there is also an underlying anxiety about what might be on their
partners’ phones during the game. I find this realistic because trusting others can be hard, and
people often hide things from each other just as the characters in the film do.
The suggestion to play the phone game occurs at 19 minutes and 1 second, and the
tensions quickly rise as secrets start to appear. For example, at 32 minutes and 27 seconds, one of
the female characters thinks she has discovered her partner’s cheating, but it turns out to be a
misunderstanding because he swapped phones with another guy to hide his secret. At 36 minutes
and 52 seconds, she is crying and drinking, showing her emotions from the confusion and
betrayal. Finally, at 41 minutes and 19 seconds, she finds out the devastating truth, which is that
her fiancé has gotten another woman pregnant. She reacts by leaving him, showing anger,
sadness, and heartbreak.
These scenes are universally relatable because they show all of human emotions shock,
betrayal, hurt, and the struggle to trust someone we care about. The film’s theme is so universally
applicable because it focuses on the issues of trust, secrecy, and honesty that arise in romantic
relationships and friendships across cultures. In conclusion, The Perfect Secret works across
cultures because it explores emotions and relationship dynamics that everyone can recognize.
The sequence of misunderstandings, revelations, and reactions like the female character’s",93,"
Hi Taleiyah, you did a good job identifying the film's central theme regarding the tension between trust and privacy. However, you conflated two separate storylines, attributing the ""phone swap"" to the couple dealing with the pregnancy secret (Simon and Bianca), when the swap actually occurred between Leo and Pepe. Next time, you can make it clear with using character names, rather than saying ""one of the female characters."" 

Additionally, it looks like you cited timestamps from Video 2 (out of three videos provided). When you have multiple video files, please indicate which video file you are referencing to help the reader find the scene (e.g., Video 2, 32:33). 

Lastly, to strengthen your argument, you can explore why the phone swap caused the confusion.

2,"This film covers a range of topics and themes such as homophobia, infidelity, and
the nature of friendship, and due to these topics it is adapted in more than 18 languages
across different cultures. The film shows how a group of friends sit at a dinner table and
explore their hidden secret. It shows how little the friends and romantic partners know
each other and how all their secrets are hidden in their phones. The film is able to be
adapted into multiple cultures because of its simplicity. The film was able to cover a
series of topics simply in the setting of friends at a dinner table playing a game. At the
core of the story is the idea that our smartphones hold our most private thoughts,
conversations, and secrets. Since smartphones are now an essential part of daily life
across the world, the fear of having one's digital life exposed is something audiences
from many cultural backgrounds can immediately relate to.
The topic also resonates universally because infidelity, trust, and secrecy are
fundamental issues in both romantic relationships and friendships. While different
cultures may have different cultural norms regarding privacy or relationships, nearly all
people understand the tension between wanting to be fully known and wanting to
protect a certain part of themselves. The dinner-table setting reinforces this universality
as sharing a meal with close friends, showing how intimate and realistic the situation is,
allowing the story to be easily adapted to different cultural contexts without losing its
impact.
There are multiple scenes that can be true for all relationships. For instance, at 42
minutes and 17 seconds, Carlotta gets a call from her childhood where she begins to
give advice on how to improve Carlotta's sex life with Leo. As a woman, this is relatively
relatable as I tell my girlfriends everything. In almost every friendship I've had with
another woman it is normal to open up about everything including more private things.
So, I believe this scene wonderfully demonstrates female friendships. Even after
Carlotta ends the conversation with her friend she doesn’t really show shame but rather
says “yes, surprise I talk to my best friend about our sex life” demonstrating the lack of
judgment and the deep trust that can exist in close friendships. This moment also shows
how different female relationships are in comparison to male friendships considering
Leo was very shocked by how comfortable she was to talk to her best friend about
private matters.
Another scene is at 29 minutes and 10 seconds of the second clip. Leo and Pepe
switched phones so Carlotta wouldn’t find out about Leo’s affair. However that soon
backfires because Pepe was hiding a secret about being homosexual. The scene erupts
into a huge misunderstanding where Carlotta believes her husband, Leo is gay.
However despite Pepe and Leo both knowing the truth of the situation, Leo refuses to
expose Pepe. This shows how deep the trust goes within their friendship. Leo’s
marriage was on the verge of collapsing but he refused to admit the truth only to defend
and protect his close friend. I believe it's fair to say that this scene can be shown across
all friendships, because in all friendships trust runs deep and it demonstrates how
friends have each other's backs no matter the situation.
Overall, the film “Perfect Secret” shows that simple settings can explore universal truths
about relationships. Through the dinner-table game and the revelations in scenes with
Carlotta and Leo, the film highlights trust, secrecy, and loyalty in both friendships and
romantic partnerships. These experiences are relatable across cultures, which is why
the story has been adapted into so many languages. The film demonstrates that,
despite cultural differences, the complexities of human relationships are truly universal.",86,"
Hi Kseniya, great job analyzing the film's gender dynamics. Your point about Carlotta was excellent: the universality here is that female friendships often involve a level of disclosure that men find shocking. 

However, you need to be much more concise. You exceeded the maximum word count by a wide margin. You have two introductory paragraphs that say essentially the same thing. You could combine these into one. 

Additionally, please proofread for phrasing and punctuation. In terms of phrasing, for example, you wrote ""Carlotta gets a call from her childhood...."" You likely meant ""from her childhood friend."" For punctuation, watch your commas. ""However that soon backfires..."" needs a comma after ""However."" "
2,"To be honest, I had to watch The Perfect Secret not once, but twice. The first time, I
was not interested in the movie and had to take a break for two days. I didn't really give it a
chance, but the second time around, I decided to take notes and really try and focus on the
characters, and wow, did I make a mistake the first time! I fell in love with Bianca; from the
moment she talked to Pepe out on the patio about how to know if you are in love. She had
such an open mind and was such a sweetheart. She was definitely too good for Simon in
my opinion. I thought it was very interesting how Eva wanted to play this game, I knew from
the start it was just to see if her husband had been cheating on her, but I don't think she
realized how big of a mess she would create. From Carlotta’s phone call with her friend
Mouse talking about her and Leo’s nonexistent sex life (Video 1 at 43 minutes and 05
seconds till Video 2 at 2 minutes and 29 seconds), all the way to Leo and Pepe switching
phones so Leo wouldn't get caught with his “companion”, as he calls her (Video 1 at 40
minutes and 11 seconds) , and Pepe having to announce to all his friends that he was gay.
(Video 3 in 2 minutes, 55 seconds). I think why almost every culture can relate to this movie
is because everyone has secrets that hide from friends, family, and loved ones. Pepe was
hiding a huge part of himself from his friends because of the fear that they wouldn't accept
him or even like him anymore, and for a moment he was right in feeling that way. All three
of his friends, Rocco, Leo, and Simon, used hurtful language, and really made Pepe feel
uncomfortable with whom he is as a gay person (Video 2 at 34 minutes and 18 seconds). I
am glad that, at the end, the three boys made it up to Pepe by beating up the man who has
been sending hateful messages to him and became friends again. I think in every culture
we need to be honest and communicate with our friends and loved ones to avoid chaos
and drama, and to support them and love them for who they are.",95,"
Hi Kealani, 

I appreciate that you took the time to watch the film twice and engage deeply with the characters the second time around. 

You mentioned that ""all three"" friends were hurtful to Pepe, but this misses the nuance of the scene: Simon was the aggressor with homophobic comments, while Rocco was actually quite supportive and tried to de-escalate the situation.

Finally, try to maintain a more formal academic tone in future assignments and double-check your grammar (see the attached suggestions). 

Overall, good work! "
2,"In the movie Perfect Secret, at 17:40 of part two, the scene where Simon sees a text from Bianca’s ex mentioning wanting to have sex causes him to immediately lose trust. This shows  a common dynamic in relationships, the fragility of trust, and how easily it can be lost, and the impact of perceived betrayal. Trust is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and once it is shaken, even by something as seemingly small as a message, it can trigger doubt, insecurity, and emotional distance. Which drags down tons of relationships these days. In this scene, Simon’s reaction is not just about the text itself but what it symbolizes: the fear that his partner might have lingering feelings for another guy or secrets. This fear resonates with many people because relationships that go the distance inherently involve vulnerability. When one partner encounters a potential threat, it can provoke a loss of confidence in the bond they share which can cause a downward spiral at least for one person. This theme is universal because human relationships rely on mutual honesty and transparency. Misunderstandings, assumptions, and external influences, such as past relationships or social media, often cause issues, but how they handle them is what makes or breaks them. Many couples experience moments when one partner misinterprets an action, a message, or even a gesture, leading to temporary distrust, if not that, frustration. If these moments are not addressed with open communication and empathy, they can escalate into larger conflicts or turn into things that had nothing to do with the original issue. The scene in Perfect Secret reflects this pattern: Simon’s immediate doubt shows how quickly trust can be ruined without a conversation.. The scene emphasizes that trust must be dealt with continuously. It also proves that insecurity, jealousy, and past experiences are common challenges in relationships. While the scenario is specific to Simon and Bianca, it mirrors real-life situations where couples must navigate misunderstandings and fears to strengthen their connection. The universality of this theme lies in its reflection of human emotion—the delicate balance between love and trust that all relationships must maintain.",95,"
Hi Luke, 

You provided a relatable analysis of how quickly trust can erode. Your observation that trust is often built on ""partial knowledge"" is insightful. 

To strengthen your essay, try to engage more deeply with the Simon/Bainca dynamic. While Bianca was indeed communicating with her ex, the text itself was likely not as explicit as you described. Analyzing how they communicate and why Simon feels threatened even by non-sexual contact would add significant depth to your analysis. 

Finally, please focus on proofreading for grammar and mechanics. You had a few sentence fragments (e.g., ""Which drags down..."") and some informal phrasing (e.g., ""tons of""). 

Overall, good work! "
2,"The film Perfect Secret is set in an environment where a group of friends gather together to
have dinner. They all then agree to play a game where they place their mobile phones on the
dinner table, allowing anyone to read any text messages that pop up, and listen to any phone
calls that occur. I believe this scenario can be universal in many cultures and used with many
other languages as the setting of a friendly social gathering is common regardless of traditions.
Around the time stamp 4:00 in the first part of the film, Eva, Sophie's mother, believes her
daughter is getting ready to go to a boy’s house as earlier she had found condoms inside her
bag. In this situation, many mothers naturally have the urge to protect their children despite any
culture.
Another significant time stamp could be at 34:00 in part 2 (or 77:13) where it is revealed that
Leo is potentially interested in men. Although the message was not meant for him, everyone
around him was shocked and appalled, especially Simon. Some made jokes about the outcome,
while Simon was furious and commented on horrible things that may be offensive. Later, when
Pepe came clean and revealed the message was meant for him, it was understandable why he
would have not wanted to disclose such with his friends based on the actions that happened. In
our current society, being interested in the opposite gender is still a hard and sensitive topic for
anyone to talk about. Different languages, or cultures, do not make it easier for people to talk
about something that is considered peculiar.
Generally, humans and people typically do not want their partners to break their trust and go off
with another significant other. The story can be told in many different languages and adaptations
as the whole circumstance could be related and seen in our current time period.",94,"
Hi Maika, 

You correctly identified two key subplots: Eva's conflict with her daughter and the Leo/Pepe/Simon dynamic regarding sexuality. 

However, be careful with your phrasing. You wrote that ""being interested in the opposite gender is still a hard topic,"" but you clearly meant the same gender. Additionally, try to go deeper in your analysis. Instead of just describing what happened (Eva found condoms), explain why it's significant. Finally, see my attached comments to your submission for grammar suggestions. 

Overall, good work! "
2,"The movie The Perfect Secret has been adapted into many different languages and
cultures because its central theme is something people everywhere can relate to, secrecy,
trust, and communication in relationships. No matter where someone lives or what culture
they belong to, most people use smartphones daily and have private conversations,
messages, or information stored on them. The idea that technology can expose hidden
truths taps into universal fears about vulnerability and honesty. Romantic relationships
and friendships across cultures often struggle with similar issues, such as jealousy, lack of
communication, and unspoken expectations, which is why the film’s premise works so
well internationally.
One scene that feels especially true for all relationships happens during the dinner
game when the first serious secret is revealed, and the mood of the group begins to shift
(At around 38 minutes). At this point in the film, what starts as a fun and harmless game
becomes uncomfortable as the characters realize how much they hide from the people
closest to them. Text messages and calls expose emotional affairs, lies, and withheld
information. This moment reflects a reality many people experience: even in close
relationships, there are things left unsaid out of fear of hurting others or being judged.
The film also emphasizes how friendships are affected by truth. Long term friends
assume they know one another well, but The Perfect Secret shows that assumptions can
be false. The fear of being judged by friends is something people everywhere understand,
which show why audiences across cultures connect with the story.
Overall, the movie’s appeal comes from its focus on human behavior rather than
cultural norms. The emotions shown, fear, love, guilt, jealousy, and regret are shared
experiences. By using modern technology as a tool to reveal hidden truths, The Perfect
Secret becomes relatable to audiences worldwide, making it easy to adapt the story to
different languages and cultural settings.",94,"Hi Victor, 

You correctly identified the film's universal themes of vulnerability and the fear of judgment. Your observation that ""assumption can be false"" even among long-term friends is a strong point. 

However, your essay is very generic. You did not name a single character (e.g., Rocco, Eva) or describe a specific plot point in detail. You mentioned a scene at 38 minutes where ""the mood begins to shift,"" but you didn't explain what happened in that scene. Without details, the essay feels like it could be about any movie. "
2,"The reason Perfetti Sconosciuti has been adapted to so many languages because it
involves in a universal experience about intimacy, privacy, and trust in relationships. Every
culture is different with romantic relationships, for example, arranged marriages and courting.
Although in this day of age it is more specifically about how modern relationships act with the
function of phones.
Regardless of cultural background, almost everyone can relate to the anxiety this issue
generates. Our text messages, pictures, search history, emotional confessions, flirtations, and
problems are now stored on smartphones. The demand for privacy is universal, despite cultural
differences in how openly people reveal their private lives. The movie's dinner-party ""game""
opens a personal fear that many people have but hardly express: the worry that total transparency
might damage rather than enhance friendship or love.
In the beginning of the game, Bianca and Simon seems such a lovely couple, but
skeptical at the same time. Simon was being weird about playing the game from the start and
having his phone being left on airplane mode (Video 1, 23 minutes 21 seconds). Simon felt it
was an invasion of privacy but ultimately, he was hiding that he got another girl pregnant from
his job. This obviously leads into complications in Bianca and Simon’s relationship.
Another relationship that was damaged was Leo and Carlotta. Both were hiding secrets
from each other. Leo was supposedly flirting on the phone with another woman and tried
swapping phones with Pepe, while Carlotta was talking to Mouse about their nearly nonexistent
sex life (Video 1 40:00- 43:13). Hearing “tips” to revive their sex life led to second hand
embarrassment and something that should not be announced to all their friends. The sexting
between Pluto and Leo was a backslap towards Carlotta and felt absolutely worthless as she
drowns her sorrows in wine.
Lastly, the coming out of Pepe being gay was quite the twist, but understandable on why
he never wanted it to public knowledge. The fear of rejection and the sake of his friendships
stopped him from even mentioning it to his closest buddies.
The global film of Perfetti Sconosciuti is universal to so many relationships because it is
not about the secrecy or being completely transparent with your partner. It is about a relationship
able to grow when boundaries between privacy and openness are carefully managed.",94,"
Hi Jayce, 

You provided a good overview of the three main conflicts. Your observation that the film is about ""managing boundaries"" rather than total transparency is a strong point. 

However, your essay has several idiom errors that impact clarity. For example, you called Leo's affair a ""backslap"" to Carlotta, but a backslap is a friendly gesture; you probably meant a ""slap in the face."" Lastly, you used the Italian title but analyzed the German characters. While it's fine to acknowledge the original, sticking to the title of the version you are analyzing avoids confusion. 

Overall, good work! "
2,"The film Perfect Secret released in 2019 was directed by Bora Dağtekin. It's about a
group of friends who meet up to have dinner together. While catching up, they each agree
they have no secrets to hide, so they decide to play a game where everyone puts their
phone on the table during dinner and any calls they get must be on speakerphone and any
texts must be read aloud. Turns out, many of them do have secrets to hide. Over the
course of the night, scandals get revealed, and chaos breaks out. However, one theme
stuck out to me can be said for all cultures, and it's that secrecy is inherently human
whether it be good or bad. The reason this theme can stick to so many cultures is because
at the end of the day, no matter where we are from, we are all human. This is because no
human is perfect at the end of the day. We all have flaws that can affect the type of person
we are and might go to extreme lengths to hide those flaws. In the scene where Leo invites
Pepe on the balcony with him to have a smoke, Leo explains he gets sent a risque photo
from a woman every night at nine and he doesn’t want his wife, Carlotta, to find out. So, he
enlists the help of Pepe to switch phones with him, so he doesn’t get caught (Video 1,
38:20 to 41:23). ‘Pepe’ gets sent a photo at 9 of the woman and Leo is in the clear. Then,
‘Leo’ gets a message from Hannes. He doesn’t answer, so Hannes calls him. He has no
choice but to pick up the phone and it’s revealed that Hannes is ‘Leos’ secret gay lover
when in reality, he is Pepe’s lover, but nobody knows because they switched phones. Leo
decides not to confess the phone's swapping and take the fall for Pepe to protect his
friend, keeping his secret (Video 2, 27:48 to 35:55). This scene shows many things about
this reoccurring topic such as no human is perfect and secrecy is human nature hence Leo
and Pepe both have secrets to keep. It also shows Leo going to an extreme length to keep
his secret hidden such as taking the fall for Pepe, which still puts his marriage in jeopardy.
",90,"Hi Abigail, you've chosen the most comedic and complex sublot in the film to illustrate your point. This scene is indeed the perfect example of the extreme lengths people go to hide their flaws. However, your essay relies too heavily on summary. You don't need to describe every beat of the scene. Instead, focus on why it matters. For example, you can analyze why Leo chooses to take the fall rather than just swapping the phones back immediately. 

Additionally, please proofread for grammar and phrasing."
2,"The Perfect Strangers is a film about a group of five friends who have known each other since childhood.  As adults, they all have families or stable jobs, and they decide to hold a reunion dinner. They play a game where everyone puts their phones on the table, and all incoming messages and calls must be shared with everyone. This game reveals many secrets, damaging their relationships and friendships. This film is highly relevant and applicable to many cultural contexts because it explores a deep aspect of human nature: secrets. No matter where you are born or what culture you grow up in, everyone has their own secrets.
The scene I found particularly insightful and thought-provoking, relevant to both love and friendship, is when Leo says he understands why Pepe hides his homosexuality after experiencing the discrimination against gay people for just one hour. This scene is at 4 minutes and 16 seconds in the third video. The reason I found this scene so impactful is that I realized that secrets exist because people are afraid of the reactions of those around them to the truth. We hide things that make us happy or things we're ashamed of, fearing that revealing them will disappoint the people we love. In the film, when the characters accidentally discover that one of them is gay, their reactions are strong and extreme, which is exactly what Pepe feared and why he hid the truth about himself for so many years. Similarly, in the context of love, when Eva discovers that her husband is seeing a therapist, even though she herself is a therapist, she is very upset and angry. This is also why he hides it from her. However, in my opinion, these extreme reactions stem not necessarily from the hidden truth itself, but from the lack of honesty. I believe the situation would be less difficult if the person keeping the secret revealed it themselves instead of being accidentally exposed. It makes the other person, whether in friendship or love, feel betrayed.",98,"Hi Gia, this is an insightful essay. You successfully identified the psychological core of the film, and your analysis of the scene with Leo and Pepe is excellent. 

However, watch your factual details. You mentioned a ""group of five friends,"" but there are actually seven people at the dinner. Also, the film we watched is titled ""Perfect Secret."" Perfect Strangers is the translation of the original movie (Italian). "
2,"(e.g., Video 1 at 26 minutes and 52 seconds) For example around this time period of the film all the characters in the movie come together and are invited to a dinner to, I assume, catch up and have a good time. But around this time frame of the movie, they specifically dive into a new topic of discussion about children and having kids or starting a family in general. Some at the table have had kids already and some have not. I interpret this as a common human interaction amongst friends and simply bouncing off of one another about their personal experiences on having kids or not. One couple at the table has babies at home (toddlers) versus another couple at the table having a 14-year-old teenager. The couple with the toddlers describes having kids is the best thing ever and they love coming home every day to them screaming and giggling. Then the other couple with the 14-year-old teenager who has an attitude, all the time, the mother of this teenager expresses that it is not all that fun having kids once they get into their teenager years. I see it as a very universal topic to speak about kids or family in general. The setting of this movie too where they all are invited to a dinner and they basically just go around the dinner table speaking about whatever and whoever. I feel like what makes this conversation more universal is the overall setting of the film and the topic of discussions they are specifically going for throughout the film.  Everyone can have family whether it be really great family conditions, bad conditions or even in the middle but overall, I feel like this could be interpreted in the other many languages this film is in because it feels like a universal topic to speak on. ",90,"Hi Aracely, 

You correctly identified that parenting differences are a universal theme. The contrast between toddlers' parents and their parents' parents is a key dynamic in the film. 

However, your essay is too generic. You did not use a single character's name, referring to everyone as ""one couple"" or ""the mother."" Additionally, the formatting needs work; you need to start an essay with a proper sentence, not a citation like ""(e.g., Video 1...)."" Lastly, please double-check for grammar, wording/phrasing, and typos. 

Overall, solid work! "
2,"I think that the driving idea behind The Perfect Secret is very basic and universal, which is why it works so well. Secrets are simply universal.  The cheating and general lies shown in the movie are exactly what's expected in someone’s life, while still being interesting enough for people to watch. Hiding of things as basic as therapy or old cigarette ad campaigns sparks discussions about how people place ideas at different levels of importance. Most people don’t bat an eye at therapy, but we’re shown multiple times Rocco getting defensive about the ineffectiveness of therapy.

This idea is expanded upon later in a much larger scene when Pepe decides to come out to the group (Video 2 at 33 min and 46 seconds), where all the characters discuss their opinions on Pepe’s choice to hide his identity. This also acts not just as a turning point in the movie but as a good scene to represent what the movie does right: secrets. We know long before the rest of the group that Pepe is hiding a big secret of him being gay. While he sits there, he has to listen to people say horrible things and is affirmed in the idea that he should’ve kept it secret, despite later admitting that he wanted them to find out. He cared about his friends enough to want to share something very personal to him, and it’s treated like something that is worthy of changing their friendship with Leo, being disgusted by the fact that they had even slept in the same bed. Overall, I think this scene represents the biggest ‘true-all’ of the movie, being people’s differences in priorities. There are only 2 characters that don’t do any wrongdoing in the movie, but the idea of priorities is still shown well with them.

Overall, most of the concepts are very transferable to different types of media or languages. The most difficult thing for them to transfer by language would be the LGBTQ messaging, due to it not being as accepted by certain faiths and cultures. Overall, I still think it handles it well, especially with certain things tying in later, such as Pepe not saying why he was resigning. The theme of priorities in truth and in lies is truly universal, even if not the same situation in each movie.",92,"
Hi David, 

You provided a solid analysis of the film's central theme, and your point about the difficulty of transferring LGBTQ themes across cultures is particularly insightful. 

However, your essay has some timeline and character confusion. You cited Video 2 (23:46) as the moment Pepe comes out; while the characters are talking about being gay at that moment, Pepe actually admits the truth and officially comes out later, in Video 3 (minutes 4-5). Additionally, be careful with character dynamics. Simon is the one disgusted by the ""sleeping in the same bed"" memory, not Leo. 

Overall, good work! 

+ For grammar, please pay attention to the use of prepositions (e.g., ""...big secret of him being gay"" should be ""...big secret about his being gay."") and wording (e.g., ""truth"" instead of ""true-all.""). "
2,"The reason as to why The Perfect Secret’s theme of privacy feels so universal to me is because it reflects the duality of a human being and how it’s so impossible to truly know a person or know how they feel, act, or even think about you without knowing their deeper side such as what is in their phone. Throughout the whole movie, friendships and relationships end up being broken due to the fact that the game was played, where something as private as one cell phone, conversations, and relationships with other people come into jeopardy when it is exposed to others. In reality, this proves that we will never be fully transparent and that no matter how much we can trust each other, there will always be something that can be misunderstood or taken out of context, which ends up ruining and harming the perspective that we have toward others and that others have toward us. An example of this is how Pepe and Eva’s relationship started crumbling down the moment they began to play the game, even though it was Eva’s idea, because the moment that the game was reaching its all time high it revealed Pepe’s affair and how he was sexting someone else who wasn’t his wife, it showed that no matter how in love you are or how much you feel about a person, you will never really know the dark side of the human brain. I can relate to this as well because when I was a child, I had internet access at a very young age, and I did not use it for studying but instead watched things inappropriate for my age and talked to people in inappropriate contexts, had people in my phone, and talked about others behind their backs. No matter how I showed myself to society, I had a dark side that I never exposed to anybody through my phone, and it was not until my mother went through it that I felt the same anxiety, fear, and panic, which closely relates to this topic because you will never fully understand what is going on in someone’s mind, not even when you look into their most private areas and that maybe the people you think you know you never really do.",93,"
Hi Daniel, 

Your personal anecdote about the ""duality"" of your own online life vs. your life was very compelling. It connected well to the film's theme. 

However, you confused the characters, stating that Pepe and Eva are a couple and that Pepe was the one sexting a woman. Eva is married to Rocco, and Pepe is the gay character. Additionally, for your future assignments, pay attention to the use of punctuation, wording, and prepositions. 

Overall, good work! "
2,"The film Perfect Secret can be universally applicable to all sorts of cultures and types of relationships by showing both the fun sides and the more negative aspects that come out of a variety of social situations, such as what the movie shows during the dinner party. A really fundamental scene that I felt really highlighted these aspects was the end scene where the group of childhood friends gets back together and they all ask Pepe to forgive them for how they behaved during the dinner game (Video 3, 14:33). While many aspects of the dinner scene itself show applicable contexts to both romantic relationships and friendships, the film ending ties very much into how these relationships can be affected by one’s actions. Pepe could have very easily chosen not to forgive them, or the group members could have split ways much like Simon and Bianca, but they chose to reconcile and try to rebuild the friendship they had as shown in the beginning of the film. By the film’s conclusion, the group decides to revisit the location they went to as kids as further symbolism of this rebuilt friendship despite how drastically the events of the dinner party changed their dynamics between them and the people they were at the party with. During the scene, Leo says “What he is trying to say is one truth didn’t come out in that game. That we love you” (Video 3, 14:48-14:54). It demonstrates a really powerful message between the friends that even if they made mistakes in the past, they want to continue to be there for each other and that despite what happened during the game and how they found out about each other’s truths, they do still care for each other. This message can apply to all individuals from different cultures or backgrounds or identities as a way to show how actions can affect people, but also how one chooses to go forward also determines the result of a situation.",99,"
Hi Kalie, this is a beautiful reflection on forgiveness, with the appropriate citation from the film. Mechanically, your writing is a bit repetitive with some words. You might want to try varing your use of intensifiers and adjectives. "
2,"The movie Perfect Secret works in so many different cultures because it focuses on things that everyone deals with in relationships and friendships. No matter where people are from, they all have secrets, fears, and moments where trust is tested. That is why this movie has been adapted into so many languages and cultures. The situations in the film feel real and relatable to almost anyone.

One scene that shows this early on is when the group is talking about superstitions during the full moon (Video 1 at 14 minutes 41 seconds). Bianca gets a text saying she has to forward a message to 666 people or something bad will happen. Even though it sounds silly, superstitions exist in every culture. They may look different, but people everywhere believe in things like bad luck, good luck, or signs. This moment shows how fear and belief don’t depend on culture, and that makes it easy for people from different backgrounds to relate to it.

Another scene that really shows why this movie works everywhere is when everyone puts their phones on the table (Video 1 at 20 minutes 35 seconds). You can feel the tension right away because everyone knows their phone has secrets on it. This is something anyone can relate to, whether it’s in a friendship or a relationship. Almost everyone has something on their phone they wouldn’t want others to see, so the stress in this moment feels very real and universal.

A very emotional scene happens when Carlotta thinks she finds out her husband is gay (Video 2 at 33 minutes 10 seconds). Even though it turns out to be a misunderstanding, her reaction feels real. Ava and Bianca immediately comfort her, which shows how friendships work across cultures. Being there for a friend during a breakdown is something people everywhere understand.

Lastly, when the men defend Pepe and stand up to someone who bullied him (Video 1 at 13 minutes 52 seconds), it shows loyalty between friends. Protecting your friends is something that feels true in any culture.

Overall, the movie works in so many cultures because the emotions, conflicts, and friendships feel real and shared by everyone.",95,"
Hi Ana, you've done a good job identifying specific moments that resonate universally. I particularly enjoyed your point about superstitions.

2,"The movie appeals to multiple cultures because it deal with themes like trust, honesty, and romantic relationships. It explores how much of peoples private lives should be shared, and how much we should trust those around us with our personal secrets and business. The conflicting ideas of privacy and transparency are themes that everyone can relate to, which is why it makes sense that the film has been adapated into so many languages. A universal moment takes place when all the characters decide to place their phones on the table and share all their calls and messages. This creates a lack of privacy within the group, causing anxiety, humor, tension, and even feelings of heartbreak.  An example is when Bianca recieves a call from her ex-boyfriend in Video 2, 28:15. The group watches her reaction, and the moment highlights the fact that even the people closest to us can be keeping so much of their lives hidden. Discovering these secrets can lead to jealousy, shock, heartbreak, and many other conflicts. The moment captures the difficulty we have balancing openness and trust with our own privacy when it comes to our many relationships. The film also address the influence that our phones and other technology has on our relationships. Our phones have become a part of our personal lives and often carry incredibly private information that we would not normally be comfortable sharing with others. The film explores the idea of our lives being displayed on a screen, and how we keep so much personal information on devices, especially within the conversations that take place on the phone. The fact that the film explores such universal themes heavily contributes to its success in multiple countries and cultures, as many can relate to the anxieties the characters must be feeling throughout the film. ",93,"Hi Erin, 

You correctly identified the central theme of privacy vs. transparency. Your observation that phones ""carry incredibly private information"" is accurate to the film's message. 

However, this essay needs proofreading. There are basic subject-verb agreement errors. Additionally, be precise with plot details. Bianca's conflict is mostly driven by texts from her ex, not the call. 

Overall, good work! "
2,"The movie ""The Perfect Secret"" has adapted into so many different languages, which shows how relatable its message is to people everywhere around the world. The reason behind why it works in so many cultures is that it deals with everyday experiences people face, like privacy, trust, and secrets in friendships or romantic relationships. Even though people live in different places and have different traditions, almost everybody uses some sort of technology to communicate and keep private information. Because of this, the conflicts in the film about personal space, honesty, and boundaries feel very relatable to people, especially as society changes and promotes the use of technology.  

   Throughout the film, the game shows how much people actually depend on their phones and how risky it might be when that private information is revealed to their closest ones. The characters in this movie think they know each other very well, but once calls and messages start appearing, many secrets come out, and tension starts to quickly build up. The film shows that privacy doesn't always mean someone is lying. Sometimes it means they want to keep their private matters to themselves. People all around the world deal with the same struggle of trying to be honest, while also needing personal space. 

   A scene that shows why this theme relates to everyone is in video 2 at 12 minutes and 30 seconds. In this scene, Pepe gets upset when the group pressures Leo to answer a text. He says that it's no one else's business to know where someone is or who they talk to. He also talks about how phones have made people feel like they can know everything about others and how this ruined people's privacy. This scene shows the main idea of this film and feels really realistic since it can happen to anyone in any relationship.

   These kinds of situations happen in real life all the time. For example, a couple might argue over unanswered texts or question who someone is talking to. Friends might get mad if messages are read and ignored, or even if the location isn't being shared. Even family members expect non-stop updates. Pepe's reaction shows that wanting privacy doesn't necessarily mean you are doing something wrong. These everyday situations still happen no matter the culture, which is why this film fits so many languages and connects the audiences through similar experiences and situations.",96,"Hi Sarah, 

You provided a very strong, well-structured essay. I particulalry liked your final paragraph, where you connected the film's themes to modern real-life behaviors. 

Your discussion of Pepe defending privacy is also accurate. To make your essay stronger, consider the character's motivation: Pepe defends privacy so passionately not just on principle, but because he has the most to lose if the game continues. Finally, watch out for passive voice errors. 

Overall, great work! "
2,"After watching the film, I started to see why so many countries have made their own versions of it. I remember watching this a long time ago on Netflix, I think another adaptation of it, and I remember it focusing on something almost everyone deals with, which is the difference between the version of ourselves we show to others and the realistic version of ourselves. Even though the movie is German, the tension around secrets, trust, and the possibility of being exposed feels familiar no matter the culture because every culture has expectations about honesty and personal boundaries.

When they start the game, it seems fun because everyone is joking around, but you can literally see people go from relaxed to tense when an uncomfortable notification pops up, which is interesting because even with close friends, there are things you keep to yourself just because everyone doesn't need to know everything about you, and the film shows how weird things can get when those lines get crossed and people suddenly feel exposed. Most relationships reach a point where avoiding a conversation only makes things heavier, and the film also shows that moment in a way that feels familiar without exaggerating it, so watching the couple finally address the elephant in the room made me think about how often people wait until they are backed into a corner before they say what they really feel.

Overall, I think the film connects with so many cultures because it deals with things people run into in real relationships, like insecurity, lying to avoid conflict, and the way cheating or even the suspicion of it can change how people act, which I think are experiences that show up in friendships and relationships everywhere, no matter the culture. The film does not rely on anything specific to German culture; it relies on situations that most people recognize from their own lives, which is what makes the story easy to adapt and why it connects with so many different cultures.",75,"Hi Mya, 

You correctly identified the film's core theme. 

However, you did not include the required timestamp, which made the essay too generic. 

Additionally, work on sentence structure; your second paragraph contains very long run-on sentences that make your argument harder to follow. "
2,"The Perfect Secret involves themes of trust and loyalty in relationships. This topic is
universal because the desire to find a committed partner is not limited to a single culture. The
film examines the complexities of human nature, revealing how ordinary people struggle with
honesty and intimacy throughout their daily lives. This can be seen with Pepe, who was
revealed to be homosexual but was still in the process of being comfortable expressing it to his
friends. Similarly, Rocco and Eva function as a couple yet have differing emotional connections
with their daughter, highlighting underlying tensions within the family.
Anyone can aspire to find love, build a family, or be surrounded by people who accept
them. These are deeply human desires portrayed throughout the film, and the fact that it has
been adapted so many times can prove how emotionally moving and relatable its message is to
global audiences.
One of the most impactful moments in the film is Rocco’s monologue to Eva. Rocco
mentions how “A lasting relationship requires both people to take a step back in order to move
forward” (The Perfect Secret, Video 2, 27:04). This connects to the film since partners
sometimes need to reflect on their relationships to determine whether they require growth or
are no longer worth saving. This reflection can be more beneficial than lying and keeping
secrets. It encourages viewers to consider whether they are truly happy in their commitments
and, if not, to be honest with themselves and their partners.
Carlotta and Leo still stayed together and raised their kids, demonstrating how some
couples remain despite the betrayal that comes from it. There have been many cases where
couples have been caught cheating or considered divorce, but stayed for financial reasons,
raising children, or social pressure. In contrast, Bianca and Simon’s storyline acknowledge how
detrimental cheating can be. For them, the betrayal permanently ended their relationship with
no opportunities for making amends.
As the movie progressed, it revealed the uncomfortable fates of certain relationships. A
topic that some genres avoid in order to maintain a wholesome, happy ending. Not all loose
ends are tied. Despite that, it did not take away from the ending that relationships grow and
adapt, reflecting a story that can happen to anyone around the world.",99,"
Hi Lyon, 

You wrote a thoughtful essay. I particularly appreciated your inclusion of Rocco's monologue.

2,"The universal theme of The Perfect Secret derives from the fact that it depicts a human behavior
which all societies demonstrate through their public displays and their private conduct. People
from different cultures show common behavior when they establish modern relationships which
technology, especially smartphones, helps create. Our phones serve as extensions of our inner
selves because they store our personal messages and hidden secrets and our deep emotional
content which we choose not to disclose even to our most trusted companions and our life
partners. The story demonstrates that trust and honesty and secrecy problems exist between
people from different cultural backgrounds because these issues appear in every human
relationship.
The film achieves its international success because it avoids using specific cultural clashes as its
primary conflict mechanism. The plot focuses on normal human relationships which develop
between friends and spouses and partners who believe they completely understand each other.
The dinner game that requires everyone to share incoming messages and calls exposes how
fragile that belief really is. Most people believe that complete transparency results in truthful
communication which makes this situation relatable at any location in the world because the film
demonstrates that total transparency is neither practical nor beneficial for people.
A text message that seems minor causes conflict between two partners who previously seemed in
harmony because it represents a relationship moment which applies to all couples (Video 2 at
approximately 30 min 15 seconds). The moment gains its strength from the message's power to
create suspicious thoughts which lead to defensive behavior and feelings of insecurity. The
situation shows that both romantic partnerships and friendship bonds face trust issues which lead
to relationship breakdowns when partners start to doubt one another. Partners who stay faithful
may conceal minor details to prevent disputes, which creates a problem about whether keeping
secrets means they have committed an act of disloyalty.
The film demonstrates that group behavior patterns undergo transformation after people share
their confidential information with others. Friends who used to trust each other now begin to
make judgments against each other while they create distance from each other and choose sides
in the conflict. The situation demonstrates that truthfulness can harm relationships through
damaging effects that occur to relationships between people and their loved ones. People from
different cultures experience difficulties when they try to honor their personal commitments
while also fulfilling their obligations towards other individuals.
The Perfect Secret connects with audiences worldwide because it presents a fundamental
question about relationships which people across the world can understand. The answer remains
unclear because the tale contains elements that resonate with different cultural groups.

Hi Hailey, 

You provided a very sophisticated philosophical analysis of the film. Your argument that the film avoids ""specific cultural clashes"" to focus on ""normal human relationships"" is an excellent insight into why the movie is so adaptable. 

However, your essay is a bit generic. You wrote +400 words without naming a single character or describing a specific scene in detail. For your future assignments, you need to ground your ideas in specific plot points. Additionally, please aim to be more concise to stay within the word count limit. 

Overall, good work! "
2,"The Perfect Secret film has been translated into multiple languages because its main
theme shows how humans universally experience the need to keep secrets from their
closest people. Trust serves as the foundation for friendships and romantic relationships
between people from all backgrounds, while their relationships also develop through their
fear, insecurity, and the need for personal space. The film shows how people react to the
sudden loss of emotional stability because this behavior exists in all human cultures.
The topic works internationally because people around the world use smartphones to
serve similar purposes. Phones store personal information which includes private
thoughts and hidden conversations and emotional connections that others cannot access.
In the film, the characters must show their true selves by revealing their phone activities,
including text messages and calls. All people will understand this situation because it is
rooted in human nature rather than through any particular cultural background.
The scene shows a universal truth which applies to all relationships when the game
begins to reveal hidden truths about the players and the atmosphere at the table shifts
from cheerful to serious (Video 2 at 31 minutes 1 second, approximate 30 minutes to 33
minutes):
The revelation of small secrets creates strong reactions between the people involved in
romantic relationships. The characters discover that they must face painful truths when
private information becomes public. People in real-life relationships hide details about
themselves because they believe it will protect their loved ones from distress.
The film shows that trust requires people to understand each other's personal boundaries
instead of expecting them to reveal everything. All friendships and romantic relationships
experience this particular obstacle. The Perfect Secret movie tells a story about jealousy
and fear and love and guilt, which are emotions that all human beings experience, making
it possible for multiple countries to create their own film adaptations of the story.",95,"
Hi Pham, you have a very strong grasp of the film's themes. You also did a great job explaining why the smartphone makes this story universal. 

However, you need to be much more specific with your evidence. You correctly identified a moment of very serious tension in Video 2. This is the scene where, after the phone swapping, Leo receives a phone call from Hannes. The movie had several serious tensions, but why did you choose this specific timestamp to explain your point? You might want to describe what is happening and connect the specific plot details to your point. 

Lastly, watch out for run-on lists. In your last sentence, you wrote ""jealousy and fear and love and guilt."" It is better to use commas. "
2,"From watching The Perfect Secret, we know that it is an adaptation of the Italian film Perfetti Sconosciuti but now in German. This is a movie where friend sit around and table and all of their messages are open to everyone. This movie is great film to watch because it is very relatable to a lot of people. This movie shows how individual people have multiple sides of themselves. For example, their romantic life, public life, and their lives with their families. The reason that this film has such a universal applicability is because is it doesn't just relate to one person or group of people. This movie can relate to almost all people around the world, since it shows something that people of different cultures, locations, and backgrounds can relate to. It is friends hanging out with each other. Smart phones are also a symbol all around the globe since nearly every country has them now and most people use them. This is what makes this film so applicable is how it shows all sorts of relationships, romantic, casual friendships, and professional, The phones however, are like a middle man of the privacy of each person.  They are not totally comfortable with sharing their privacy with others even though they are all close friends, which we can see at around the 20 minute mark. At first they all agree to play the game, and it is all funny. Shortly after however, a notification shows up and that joy and humor changes to uncomforted. This scene is true for both romantic relationships and friendships because it shows how trust can easily be broken. The trust isn't just where others are laughing at you, it is also how you now realize that a person you thought you knew could be hiding a whole different side of themselves. I'd say all viewers of this movie, regardless of culture or race could relate to this movie, and especially when you see the tension in the film rise due to something so small. This movie had all aspects of human life that can be connected to relationship, since there were secrets hidden, technology, and tension  building due to emotions.",90,"Hi Ryan, you've correctly identified the central theme of the film, that humans have multiple sides and that the smartphone acts as the gatekeeper between them. 

However, the essay relies too much on general statements without concrete examples to back up the reflection. You mention that at the 20-minute mark, ""a notification shows up,"" but you don't say whose notification it is or what it says. To make your argument persuasive, you need to be specific. Also, try to expand your vocabulary. You used the word ""relate"" or ""relatable"" too frequently in this short response. Instead of just saying the movie is relatable, explain why. 

Finally, please proofread carefully for grammar (e.g., article omission, subject-verb agreement) and missing words."
2,"I interpreted the main theme of The Perfect Secret as the negative and positive impact secrets and lies can have in relationships. Relationships can be broken or strengthened after the secrets and lies are revealed. This theme is a relatable and common occurrence in many cultures. This is explored throughout the film. The friend groups romantic relationships and friendships with each other are continuously shattered with each revealing phone call and text message. 

The theme occurs worldwide. Regardless of culture and language, people have emotions. People have different insecurities and fears. Romance can become difficult because of many factors such as age, finances, work, and families. The same can be said for friendships. Issues with romantic relationships can lead to poor decisions by either partner, such as cheating. Friends trying to protect each others secrets can lead to unexpected problems that continue to snowball. This was seen with the switching of Pepe and Leo's phones.

A situation I found to be particularly true for all relationships was Rocco, Leo, and Simon standing up for Pepe at the end of the film (Video 3, 13:50). They confronted the father of a child at Pepe's school. They ultimately stopped the father from harassing Pepe for being gay. Pepe was able to maintain his job and image. I think this shows how powerful the bonds people share with each are. Also the lengths they are willing to go through in order to protect each other. They all had an uncomfortable experience when finding out Pepe was gay. Pepe had fears of losing his friends and job because of it. He also had fears of introducing his love interest to his friends after he saw how deceitful and disrespectful most of them were. In the end, their friendship and loyalty to each other persevered.

People lie and keep secrets from the persons closest to them for numerous reason. In the movie it was mostly to protect themselves from accountability for their actions. The majority of characters knew what they had done was wrong and the harm it would bring upon their image and relationships. There were some exceptions, such as Pepe and Bianca's situations. They didn't necessarily do anything deceitful or shameful in my opinion. ",95,"Hi Nelson, 

You provided an interesting interpretation of the film, specifically regarding how secrets can have both negative and positive impacts on relationships. 

For your next assignments, I want you to focus more on grammar and mechanics, particularly with possessives and sentence structure. For example, ""The friend groups romantic relationships..."" should be ""friend group's."" Additionally, watch out for sentence fragments. 

Finally, you concluded by stating that Pepe and Bianca were exceptions who ""didn't necessarily do anything deceitful."" While Pepe's situation is clear, if you mention Bianca in this category, you need to elaborate on why. 

Oveall, great work! "
2,"The theme of The Perfect Secret has such universal applicability because it centers on privacy, trust, and hidden identities, issues that exist in every culture, regardless of language, religion, or social norms. While cultures differ in how openly people communicate, nearly all relationships involve some level of secrecy, whether intentional or unconscious. Smartphones, which play a central role in the film, have become global tools that store our most private thoughts, conversations, and desires. Because phones are so deeply integrated into modern life across the world, the idea of exposing everything on them immediately creates tension that audiences everywhere can relate to.

What makes the film adaptable across so many cultures is that it does not rely on culture-specific conflicts but instead focuses on emotional truths common to human relationships. Romantic partners everywhere struggle with honesty versus self-protection, and friendships often depend on selective disclosure to maintain harmony. The film shows that secrets are not always malicious; sometimes they exist simply because full transparency can be emotionally damaging.

A particularly universal moment occurs during the dinner party game when the group agrees to place their phones on the table and read all incoming messages aloud (Video 1 at approximately 18 minutes). This situation is relatable across cultures because it highlights the unspoken rule that everyone has a private inner life, even among close friends or partners. As messages begin to arrive, the characters’ anxiety reflects a shared human fear: being seen too completely. This scene demonstrates how quickly trust can unravel when boundaries disappear, a concept that applies to both romantic relationships and friendships worldwide.

Another powerful aspect of this scene is how it shows that secrecy does not always equal betrayal. Some secrets protect others’ feelings or preserve social stability. This moral ambiguity allows audiences from different cultures to project their own values onto the situation, making the film flexible and widely resonant.

Ultimately, The Perfect Secret succeeds globally because it asks a question that transcends culture: How much truth can a relationship survive? In an age where technology constantly threatens privacy, the film captures a shared modern anxiety that feels true in almost any society.",98,"
Hi Luke, great job on this. You've nailed the central tension of the film, particularly with your concluding question. To strengthen your essay, try providing more concrete examples. You mention that ""characters' anxiety reflects a shared human fear,"" but you don't mention which character. Using specific names and plot points will prove that you are deeply analyzing the content. Also, try to avoid generalizing phrases like ""audiences everywhere"" or ""in every culture"" too often. While true in this context, it can sometimes sound like an overgeneralization. "
2,"The Perfect Secret is a dialogue-driven movie about a group of friends catching up over
dinner. Tension builds throughout the movie through a game of “Coming Clean,” which requires
all seven friends to place their phones face up, ringers on, in the center of the table. Eva, Rocco’s
wife, suggests the game because she fears Rocco is hiding secrets or infidelity from her.
However, while Rocco avoids being called out, the rest of the group is forced to reveal various
secrets and information as their phones light up with new notifications.
I chose the scene sequence from section 2 from (00:27:48) to (00:35:33) provided in the
Module 2 film page. This scene reveals “Leo’s” gay lover and the subsequent reactions from his
wife, Carlotta, and his lifelong friends. It is a scene built on tension and confusion, and it
pressures Leo to dig himself deeper into a lie he made for himself.
I believe this scene relates to and is true for all romantic or platonic relationships because
of the principle behind the friends’ anger. Carlotta, Leo’s wife, leaves the table because, from her
perspective, Leo is cheating on her with a man. Eva and Bianca follow her to comfort her while
Carlotta pours and gulps more wine. Meanwhile, the men sit at the table to understand the
situation and Leo’s newfound sexuality. This is especially true for Simon, who feels that Leo has
betrayed him for not sharing the information.
Thus, the principle of the situation is that lies will come out one way or another,
especially between people who know each other. Each friend has their own secrets about
themselves, which are revealed and explored throughout the game, but “come clean” when a
message or call comes through. The only time this does not work is when the person lies or
ignores a message instead of telling the truth. Simon, for example, was having an affair with
another woman and blamed it on work, which ultimately resulted in his breakup. And Leo’s
affair with a younger woman spurred him to swap his and Pepe’s phones. Ignoring Hannes’s
messages, though not his to respond to, worsened the situation Leo had unintentionally placed
himself in and placed more strain on the already-thinning relationship between himself and his
wife.",94,"
Hi Isabella, you've effectively identified the snowball effect of lying as the universal theme. You also touched on a specific gender dynamic in the reaction scene. 

However, I would have liked a bit less plot summary in the first two paragraphs. You could have jumped straight into your analysis of why Simon felt so betrayed by Leo's ""secret."" 

Also, providing a simple timestamp is fine without the phrase ""provided in the Module 2 film page.""

Lastly, you referred to the men trying to understand ""Leo's newfound sexuality."" Without quotation marks, this phrase implies that Leo actually has a newfound sexuality. "
2,"I found the movie The Perfect Secret very interesting, which made me want to watch more. I even watched it more than once because I began to notice small details that indicated there were secrets between all of the friends from the very beginning. For example, the earrings Simon gave to Eva, or the photos Rocco received at the beginning, may have been related to his profession as a plastic surgeon. However, this is never fully explained, even though he is shown with a second cellphone at the end of the movie.

I find this topic and theme universal because cellphones are such an important part of our daily lives. Eva, who is a psychologist, mentions this idea at 17 minutes and 20 seconds into the movie, explaining that our phones contain GPS data, search history, blogs, messages, photos, location information, and personal details. This is when she states that everyone has something to hide and proposes a game called “Coming Clean.”

I found this relatable because most relationships are built on trust, but nobody is perfect, and some people do have things they keep hidden. Many relationships end because a partner searches the other’s phone and finds something unsettling. I also found this personally relatable because my wife and I have access to each other’s phones and have searched through them in the past. However, after many years, we grew to trust one another and slowly stopped doing that. We now have no problem with the other person using our phone, and have nothing to hide.

Overall, this movie sheds light on how people behave in the world today and how dependent we are on technology, especially our cellphones. It shows what could happen if someone took our phone and decided to go through it. Whether it is a friend, partner, or a stranger, the information on our devi",100,"
Hi Daxton,

You provided a strong personal connection to the theme, sharing how you and your wife navigated trust and phone privacy. This personal insight was the highlight of your essay. 

Excellent job on this! "
2,"The theme seems to have such universal applicability because in reality, in every
relationship, no matter the culture, everyone has secrets and people struggle with honesty.
In our world today, phones are a major issue in most relationships. While they can be used
to connect and build relationships with one another, they can also be used to hide things.
In the film, “Perfect Secret”, (about eleven minutes into the third part of the film), they find
Carlotta's car and think she jumps off the bridge. This shows how fast secrets can create a
sense of panic.
When the friends pull up to the car parked right next to the bridge, they automatically
think the worst. They assume that Carlotta has jumped off the bridge. This moment is
important to the theme because it shows how hiding things through a phone and not being
honest leads to extreme assumptions based on fear and mistrust within everyone. They
panic and blame themselves for what they assumed had happened. Outside of the film, in
real life, when others do not know the truth about something, they often lose trust in their
partner. This often then leads to damaged relationships and emotions due to assumptions
being made and secrecy.
The theme of secrecy is proven to be universal, as it shows the behaviors of others in real
life relationships throughout all cultures
",91,"
Hi Haley, 

You provided a compelling and dramatic example with the bridge scene. Your analysis of how ""extreme assumptions based on fear"" can lead to panic is excellent. 

However, your essay is under the minimum requirement (300 words). To improve this, you can expand on your analysis. For instance, after mentioning the panic at the bridge, explain how that misunderstanding was resolved and what it taught the characters about their relationships. "
2,"The German film Das perfekte Geheimnis or The Perfect Secret works effectively across cultures because it focuses on universal dynamics of human relationships: secrecy, trust, social pressure, and the fear of being judged, rather than culture specific dynamics. In this film, secrecy is treated as both normal and dangerous in relationships. This theme first appears in clip 1 at 17:35, when Eva asks, ""How many couples would it ruin if one looked through the other's phone?"" While the question she presents is important, what stands out is how uncomfortable each guest becomes as Eva frames secrecy as an assumed part of intimacy. A few minutes later, at 18:56, Eva pushes further by saying, ""So you're all claiming to have no secrets?"" Secrecy functions as a protective mechanism. Across cultures, people withhold information not necessarily out of hate or bitterness, but out of fear of conflict, rejection, or loss of control. The phone simply places these details in one, tangible place, making the tension visible.

Social pressure further explains why characters choose secrecy over honesty. Around 33-34 minutes in clip 1, Leo expresses resentment toward paternity leave and describes feeling forced to conform in order to be accepted. This pressure becomes more apparent later at 13:20 in clip 2, when he exclaims, ""These damn [phones] are ruining us. They rob us of our privacy!"" His defensiveness shows his anxiety about failing to meet social expectations. Although the specifics of gender roles and success differ by culture, the fear of judgement and exclusion is nearly universal. 

The film also explores why people often communicate indirectly by sharing grievances with others instead of addressing issues directly. Near 42 minutes in clip 1, Carlotta's friend calls, discussing Carlotta's intimate life, revealing private information about her and Leo. A similar patterns appears around 18:20 in clip 2, when Matti asks Bianca if her therapist friend (Eva) is still being ""b----y."" These moments show how indirect communication allows people to release frustration without confronting uncomfortable situations. However, the film shows that this behavior often leads to feelings of betrayal when secrets rise to the surface. This dynamic is widely relatable because it shows a common theme: people participate in private communication while expecting loyalty and discretion from others. ",99,"Hi Madison, 

You provided a sophisticated analysis of social pressure. I particulalry loved your point about Leo's resentment toward paternity leave. 

For your next assignment, please do a quick grammar check before submitting; you had some small errors (""A similar patterns appears"" ""...Carlotta's intimate life, and revealing private...""). 

Overall, great job! "
2,"One of the most universal scenes in the movie occurs about 45–50 minutes into the movie, where a revelation about a connection between one couple and another couple causes some drama. When a person discovers that their partner or spouse has engaged in an emotional/romantic affair it creates a huge conflict, and is extremely relatable. As everyone has experienced this same type of shock, hurt, confusion when finding out about a loved one, that event will be the catalyst for many relationships. This applies not just to intimate relationships, but also to friendships. Most everyone has felt betrayed or hurt by someone in a friendship, or has felt kept feelings for someone hidden over time.

 The fact that the characters experience these types of situations is where The Perfect Secret benefits from having such a wide audience. Everything from phones to social networks and private messaging crosses international borders, and as a result, people have similar reactions to the same kind of ""secret"" storylines involving guilt, laughter, embarrassment. These can be universally expressed, no matter the culture. The Perfect Secret places its characters in a social environment that is relatable to all humans, and deals with emotional themes that all people understand, it demonstrates how it might work in just about any culture. The example of one partner receiving a hidden or secret text message is an incredibly strong example of how secrets and misunderstandings and hidden truths can very much affect a relationship, whether you live in the U.S. or China or anywhere else.

Hi Alexander,

You touched on the right themes—betrayal and the universality of ""shock"" in relationships. Your point about how technology makes these reactions consistent across borders is valid.

However, this essay is too short and too generic. You did not meet the minimum word count (300 words), and you did not use a single character's name. Referring to the characters only as ""one couple"" or ""a person"" makes it seem like you didn't engage deeply with the specific story of The Perfect Secret. Next time, please use specific names (e.g., Leo, Carlotta) and describe exactly what happens in the scene you are analyzing (e.g., ""When Leo receives the text from...""). Connected to this, please cite specific timestamp (e.g., Video 1, 45:03). 

Lastly, please proofread for grammar (e.g., punctuation issues, phrasing)."
2,"The Perfect Secret (Das perfekte Geheimnis) resonates among cultures because it mostly revolves around themes that are universally human: trust, honesty, privacy, and some hidden aspects of relationships. Even though some of the norms as dating, friendship, and communication differs in cultures, there is one important thing that all of us have in common- smartphone. Phones have become extensions of our private lives, storing conversations, secrets, and emotional connections that even our closest friends or partners may not know. And that is alone enough reason for the film to be adapted into so many languages worldwide from the original Italian film Perfetti Sconosciuti. 

The film also suggests that secrecy is not unusual but something human beings have inherited. People around the world choose what they want to share and what to keep private. Regardless cultural background, the tension of keeping secrets exists mostly in relationships, friendships, and even families. The dinner-game structure allows audiences to imagine themselves in the same situation and ask uncomfortable but relatable questions: What would my phone reveal about me? Would my relationships survive complete transparency?

A particular universal scene occurs when everyone gets their phones down on the table and agrees to read out the messages that arrive out loud (Video 1, 19'). At the beginning, everyone is just laughing and being nonchalant, but as you watch the film, you can see the tension and discomfort. So even the people who love each other, trust each other, have also some private thoughts and conversations that they are not ready-or willing- to share, that's exactly what this scene captures. The fear on the characters’ faces reflects a common anxiety felt across cultures: being fully seen might lead to judgment, rejection, or loss.

That situation is especially true for romantic relationships, where trust mostly matters the most and honesty often clash with reality or emotional complexity. I think, this film mostly concentrates at showing that privacy is deeply connected with identity, which, of course, means that it's not quite is about betrayal or cheating. When privacy disappears, trust can be exposed as being fragile. And The Perfect Secret speaks to general human experience, making it powerful and relevant far beyond its original setting.",92,"
Hi Dinara,

You provided a thoughtful analysis of the central theme. I really liked your argument that ""privacy is deeply connected with identity."" This is a sophisticated way of looking at the film.

However, your essay is too generic. You did not use a single character's name (Rocco, Eva, Leo, etc.). To demonstrate that you engaged with the specific film assigned, you need to use concrete evidence: Who was afraid? What specific secret were they hiding? Additionally, please proofread for grammar, specifically focusing on prepositions (""regardless of"") and articles (""the smartphone"").

Overall, good work! "
2,"The German movie The Perfect Secret shows a theme that seems to work in almost any culture, how honesty, trust, and privacy affect relationships. The movies main idea is that a group of friends decides to share all the messages on their phones during a dinner. This situation creates a lot of tension, surprises, and funny moments. I think this story can be told in so many different countries because almost everyone has a phone and uses it to talk to friends, family, or romantic partners. Everyone also has secrets or things they keep private, so the story feels familiar no matter where you live.

One scene that really shows this is around 12 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, when the game starts and Bianca realizes how much personal information everyone can see. The friends all react with awkward laughter, shock, and a little panic. This scene shows how hard it is to balance honesty and privacy in relationships. It’s something everyone can relate to because we all have moments when we don’t want others to know everything about us, even our closest friends or partners. Another part that feels universal is when Pepe helps his student talk to a girl on social media. It shows that people often try to help each other but might do it in ways that reveal secrets or private things. These moments are both funny and real because they show how complicated relationships can be, even with good intentions.

Overall, I think The Perfect Secret works in so many cultures because it talks about things that are true for everyone trust, curiosity, and dealing with secrets. The story uses a smartphone, which everyone knows, but it’s really about how people interact, what they hide, and how they deal with each other. That’s why the movie has been adapted into so many languages and still makes sense everywhere.",84,"Hi Ciara,

You correctly identified the film's central themes of trust and privacy.

However, you claimed that the game starts around 12:30, but at that point in the film, the characters are simply having a conversation about Pepe's new partner; the game has not begun.

Additionally, phrases like ""awkward laughter, shock, and a little panic"" and ""funny moments"" are a bit general. To improve, you need to analyze why the character behaves as they do. Lastly, be careful with punctuation errors and possessive apostrophes.

Overall, good work! "
2,"I believe that the movie is trying to convey that everyone has issues with communication and secrecy in relationships. This theme has universal applicability because it reflects the truth that people aren’t completely honest in relationships. We might do it because we want to preserve the relationship and are worried that the truth might harm it.

This idea is particularly evident in how Pepe comes out in Video 3 starting at 3 minutes and 0 seconds. Pepe first calls out the casual homophobia that his friends do. This highlights one element of why Pepe did not come out to them. He felt that his friends might not accept him and that the Peretti Gang might disband, which is a group that represents a reprieve from the harassment from his workplace.

Only at the end, when other people shared their secrets, did he share his. This highlights how once communication becomes more common does other people feel more confident in sharing. Even if the communication was forced like it was in the phone game at the dinner.",70,"
Hi Joshua, 

You identified a strong central theme regarding why we hide the truth. Your analysis of Pepe's motivation is excellent.

However, this essay does not meet the basic requirements of this assignment. At 176 words, it is far too short to count as a complete analysis. You need to elaborate on your points significantly to reach the 300-word minimum. Also, before submission, please review your grammar, specifically the sentence ""does other people feel,"" which is confusing."
2,"I think that the topic of the movie fits into so many different cultural contexts because cheating is sadly a pretty common issue in many cultures across the world. I think it also plays into people's fears that their loved ones might be hiding things from them. It also plays into people’s love for drama. In the film every time a phone chimes it is a whole new piece of information that may expose something about each character. When these secrets are revealed, it also exposes how others truly feel about those secrets. In the scene when they read the messages on Pepe’s phone thinking it was Leo’s, Simon and Leo reacted negatively to the idea even using slurs like “faggot.” By the end of the movie though, it is shown that they all manage to accept Pepe as being gay. In Video 3 at 14 minutes and 30 seconds it shows the friends going to Pepe’s school to invite him on a camping trip. This scene I feel shows something that is true for all relationships, that true friends will be accepting of who you are. When the topic was brought up the first time Simon and Leo talked quite negatively about it and then they tried to make it seem that they did not mean what they said. Later when they came to invite him on the camping trip they did not show any ill feelings toward him. I think that this ending may have also played into the cross-cultural success of the movie because it showed that people will still accept you even if your secrets become exposed. It is like how Pepe even said he partially was hoping that it would come out at dinner that he was gay so that he did not have to hide it any longer.  ",100,"Hi Alexander, 

You did a great job identifying the film's main tension. You also correctly pointed out the harsh reality of Simon and Leo's homophobia during the phone swap scene, using specific evidence to support your point. I enjoyed reading your essay! "
2,"One reason The Perfect Secret has been adapted so widely across cultures is that it focuses on relationship issues that most people recognize in their own lives. No matter where someone lives, close relationships involve a balance between honesty and privacy. The film shows how easily that balance can be disrupted when private communication becomes public, revealing emotions and insecurities that exist in many friendships and romantic relationships around the world.

A scene that clearly reflects this universality occurs when the group decides to place their phones on the table and agree to share every message and call that comes in (around 34–36 minutes into the film). What stands out in this moment is how casual the decision initially seems. Several characters laugh or make jokes, suggesting confidence in their relationships. This reaction feels familiar, as many people believe trust exists simply because major conflicts have not yet surfaced.

As the game unfolds, however, the tension becomes obvious. Even messages that are not serious or romantic cause discomfort between partners. For example, a seemingly harmless text from a coworker creates suspicion and defensiveness, showing how easily trust can be shaken when context is removed. This situation applies to many real-life relationships, where partners may not be hiding betrayal but still worry about how certain interactions might be perceived. The fear is not always about guilt, but about being misunderstood.

The scene also affects the group’s friendships. Conversations become awkward, humor feels forced, and the mood shifts noticeably as personal information is exposed. This reflects how friendships often rely on unspoken limits. People may care deeply for one another while still choosing not to share everything. When those boundaries disappear, relationships are tested in uncomfortable ways.

What makes this theme work across cultures is that it does not depend on specific traditions or values. Instead, it highlights shared human emotions—vulnerability, fear of judgment, and the desire to protect oneself. The Perfect Secret ultimately suggests that complete transparency is not always necessary for strong relationships. In many cases, understanding and discretion are what allow both romantic relationships and friendships to endure.",88,"Hi Esther, 

Great job on this. Your observation that ""trust exists simply because major conflicts have not yet surfaced"" is a profound psychological insight. 

However, your essay needs to be more specific. You mention a ""harmless text from a coworker."" Who received this? Was it a specific character in the film, or a hypothetical example? Without names or specific details, the essay feels a bit generic. 

Additionally, your timestamp for the start of the game is incorrect. The game actually begins much earlier, around 19:21 in Video 1 (the ""Coming Clean"" scene). The segment you cited actually covers the conversation about the difficulties of being a stay-at-home dad and Bianca's inheritance. For future assignments, please ensure you ground your analysis in concrete evidence with accurate timestamps. "
3,"The scene starts at 6:19 where Martin can be seen relaxed in his home, reading a book, when his wife passes by him announcing she is off for her work. He was already deep in thought before the scene started and as Anika was scrambling through her things, he asked her, pointblank whether he has become boring. Anika hesitates to answer before saying that he is not the same as he was when they were young. Martin scoffs at the answer right before the scene changes. While this was a short scene, I think it shows how Martin wanted to talk about the isolation he feels in their marriage, but is unable to go on. In the second part of the film, at 1:45, Martin takes a sip from his tumbler like it's his morning coffee and moves right away into interacting with the class. With more enthusiasm and confidence than before, he asks one of his students to vote for of the three leaders he just described. He craftily described two great leaders as people with terrible health and habits and the fascist as a conventional good person. While Martin says that the takeaway from that interaction is the world is unpredictable, I think it shows how Martin subconsciously tries to justify his early stages of alcohol dependency. In his mind, he is a good person with a bad habit because his bad habit is turning him into a better teacher. While Martin's experiment improved his life greatly, the moments of success that Martin felt only lasted while the alcohol did. As the effects wore off, so did the joy and motivation and Martin took that as a sign to drink more rather than an indication that alcohol was just a temporary solution. In the third act, as his relationship with Anika worsens and he realizes that his alcoholism is being noticed by his children, he falls back into depression. Tommy's death is the final knot: alcohol wasn't solving anything, it was just an escapism. Alcohol gave him the illusion of control over his life that he always craved. At the end, when Martin finally agrees to dance, i think it's a great indication of how Martin finally choose the things he actually has control over in his life. That, to me, is the main takeaway.",97,"
Hi Areebah, 

You offered a fantastic insight that Martin's lesson about Churchill is a subconscious attempt to justify his own drinking. That is a brilliant observation. 

For your next assignment, please work on the following areas: 

punctuation (e.g., ""...He was already deep in thought before the scene started, and as Anika..."")
preposition (e.g., ""...him announcing she is off to her work."")
verb form (e.g, ""...whether he had become boring."") 
determiner (e.g., ""...he asks one of his students to vote for one of the..."")
capitalization (e.g., ""...when Martin finally agrees to dance, I think..."") 
Overall, great work! "
3,"The film ”Another Round” has many twists in the outcomes of alcohol endorsement.
Even though keeping a BAC of 0.05% was supposed to make everyone feel more relaxed in the
experiment, it soon became something that grew out of control, leading to many damaged
relationships, and ruined reputations. In the film, Martin seems depressed and sad, trying to
reconstruct his marriage (Another Round, video 4, 1:27). He realized the outcomes of
participating in the experiment, and the effects of going overboard with drinking. In this scene,
he is telling his ex wife he misses her and is trying to apologize for his behavior. He seems to be
holding a lot of regret in his actions, stating that he wishes he was back together with his wife.
Shortly after, Anika leaves the table saying she can no longer love him or be with him. On the
other hand, Martin seems happy in the scene where he is canoeing with his family (Another
Round, video 3, 1:02). They are trying to race down to the land in front of them, laughter is
shared, and Martin seems truly happy around his family for the first time in the movie. After this
clip the film displays “0.0%” showing that he did not have any drinks before this activity. I believe
this shows the true meaning of the film. While Martin's drinking was the reason this trip was
even planned, he is truly happy to spend time with his family doing an activity they used to do
together many years ago. However, after this he gets very drunk with his friends doing the
experiment, and this ends up very poorly. As a result, he has to explain his actions to his kids
and wife. Anika brings up her concerns on how she has felt invisible to Martin for years. This
shows that Martin gained the insight of being able to have fun with his family without alcohol. It
also shows him the damage drinking can do to his relationships. The final message of this film is
that temporary placeholders, such as drugs or drinking, will never solve problems but make
them much worse. This is why there was a temporary relief for Martin when he started drinking
and teaching right after, but the overall result ended up with him losing his wife and being a bad
example for his children.",95,"
Hi Diana, 

You selected two strong scenes to contrast Marin's emotional state. 

While you have a good understanding of specific scenes, the essay reads a bit confusingly due to its organization. Currently, you present the restaurant scene (Video 4, 1:27), which occurs after the canoeing trip and the incident where Martin passes out on the street, before introducing the canoeing trip itself (Video 3). The essay would flow much more smoothly if you explained these scenes in the order they appear in the film, especially when you make the connection between these scenes. 

Additionally, for your next assignment, please pay attention to your use of punctuation (e.g., commas) and ensure you use the appropriate verb forms. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"In Another Round Martin's emotional state is clearly revealed during two closely connected scenes in the third video. Around 23:53, as Martin leaves his friend's house, he appears visibly defeated and emotionally exhausted. Reflecting the ongoing strain between him and his wife Anika. Their relationship is marked by poor communication, emotional distance and a sense of mutual disappoint, which weighed heavy on Martin. Although Martin's friend tells him that I am ""rooting for you, Martin. And Anika. You know?"" He further points points out Martin that it has always been him and his wife, ""Martin and Anika."" In that moment Martin does not respond with optimism, instead his defeated posture suggests that the marital troubles have left him feeling isolated, discouraged about the future of their relationship.

Shortly after, at approximately 29:22, the tone of moment shifts. As Martin is about to leave, his friend tells him. ""You can do anything."" After the door closes, Martin pauses and takes a moment to reflect on what was said. This brief hesitation is significant, as it signals a quiet emotional change. His expression softens, and it becomes clear that the reassurance has reached him. In this moment he realizes that he is not alone in his suffering. This allowed him to realize for the first time in film that he has someone genuinely in his corner who truly believes and supports him. This moment restores a small but important sense of hope. Knowing that someone believes in him and supports him and his marriage gives Martin emotional stability at his lowest moment. This scene highlights the importance of true friendship, the power of positive affirmation as well as human connection. Showing that no matter how down and out you maybe if you have someone in your corner to provide you with love and support that it can restore your faith yourself.",90,"Hi Larry, 

You focused on the theme of friendship, which is certainly present in the film. The bond between the teachers is indeed a support system for Martin. 

However, your essay misses the most critical component of Martin's transformation: the role of alcohol and the film's final message. While friendship helps him grow, the movie is fundamentally about how the drinking experiment impacts his life. To fully answer the prompt, you need to discuss the main events, specifically Tommy's funeral and Martin's dance at the harbor. These moments are essential for understanding his change in attitude. 

Additionally, please proofread for the following areas: 

punctuation (e.g., ""In Another Round, Martin's)
word form (e.g., ""...emotional distance, and a sense of mutual disappointment"") 
word choice (e.g., ""However, Martin's friend tells him..."")
redundancy (e.g., ""He further points points.."") 
preposition (e.g., ""...points out Martin that..."""
3,"After watching the film, we got to see the transformation of each character and how the emotions
fluctuated throughout the whole film. The influence of alcohol is never the solution to anything, but that
did bring out different sides of Martin as we saw, and influenced him to change his ways by the end of
the film. In (Video 1 at 6 minutes and 30 seconds), we can see Martin lying in bed and slouched. He asks
his wife, Anika, if he has become boring. He knows himself that he has changed, and that is because of
his alcohol consumption and overuse of it. She claims that he is not the same as when they were together
in their younger years. That is because he probably didn't know what alcohol was and how addicted you
can get to it. He is so addicted to it that he is drinking it on his job during school hours. Martin also shows
signs of depression in the following scenes as he is teaching the class due to his disinterest and slow,
boring tone of voice. In (Video 3 at 28 minutes and 26 seconds), he visits his friend Tommy at his house.
Tommy keeps repetitively grabbing a beer from the fridge, but Martin tells him enough is enough. He's
trying to get him to change as well. I think Martin realized that he had reached his limit, and the amount
of alcohol that he is consuming is really affecting his personal life and well-being. Also Alcohol
consumption has led to Deaths which he has seen, so he has taken that into consideration. Martin is really
trying to change his life for the better. Even if it wasn't a permanent solution, it showed a growth in
progress and the change of attitude he had towards the consumption of alcohol. As the film progressed, I
saw friendships grow and relationships strengthen. I think the struggle of alcohol coming from a couple of
characters made their connections stronger and helped Martin realize there's more to life than drinking.
Life is a celebration and should be valued. Also, he saw one of his students was struggling, and when
Martin saw how happy the student was when he finally reached his goal, that inspired and led him to set
his own goal in decreasing his alcohol consumption. Martin's Journey ultimately had huge growth
throughout the film, and he rediscovered himself by the end of the film through his ups and downs.
Martin's problems gave him that urge to be a better version of himself.",92,"
Hi Marley, 

You correctly identified the theme that ""life is a celebration."" 

However, your essay contains a major plot error regarding the beginning of the film. You argued that Martin was ""boring"" and depressed because of his alcohol addiction. In reality, Martin is sober at the start of the film (he even refuses a drink at the first dinner). The experiment happens because he is bored, not the other way around. Understanding that he starts as a sober, boring teacher is crucial to understanding why he decides to try the experiment. Additionally, the final scene (Martin's dance at the harbor) suggests a more complex relationship with alcohol than just a decision to ""decrease consumption."" Finally, please proofread for grammar and phrasing (see attached comments to your submission).

Overall, good work! "
3,"In Another Round, Martin is introduced as a middle-aged teacher, who is observed to be
In Video 1 at 9 minutes 30 seconds, we see Martin interacting with his family. His
relationships to both his wife and children are strained and he behaves passively towards
them. As he walks into the room where his sons are, he holds his gaze towards them for a
moment, perhaps to convey that he also sees the same apathy and is concerned about the
behavior he is modeling for them. He passionlessly tells his friends at dinner that he would
not leave his wife because she is the mother of his children and she took care of his father
before he died. He said nothing of her qualities, personality, or even her physical
attributes, nothing about who she is as a person, nor anything that He may feel that he has
nothing to lose by participating in the drinking experiment, as he has not found a better way
to engage with his family or with his life up until now. Once the experiment begins, there is
a marked difference in Martin’s attitude and actions. In Video 2 at 23 minutes 42 seconds,
we see him
When the group decides to stop the experiment, they cite negative social consequences as
the reason. While they do experience positive effects, such as a higher energy baseline
while at work, they also find that these come at a cost. Martin, for instance, experiences
the embarrassment of waking up in front of a neighbor’s house, being found and guided
home by his young son and later having to provide an explanation for his behavior to both
his sons. The same pattern follows, where he looks at his children and seemingly reflects
on what example he is setting for them as they grow up. The others, too, experience
personal and professional consequences from how their behavior affects those around
them. It is for this reason, they decide that these negatives outweigh whatever benefits
being perpetually intoxicated offered them. The ending shows, though, that they are not
swearing off alcohol altogether, though. They concede that there are situations and
locations that are socially accepted as being appropriate for imbibing alcoholic drinks and
indulging in the high they offer, and there are others where it is not considered acceptable.
This could be seen as a direct challenge to the philosophies of Kierkegaard…",95,"Hi Alexis, 

You selected two excellent opposing scenes to demonstrate Martin's transformation. 

You argue that Martin gives up intoxication to save his marriage, which is true for the climax. However, the movie ends with Martin drinking and dancing wildly at the harbor. Integrating that final dance into your conclusion would have made your analysis of the film's message much more accurate. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"In the film Another Round, Martin’s character goes through a clear change from being
unmotivated and unhappy to feeling more alive and engaged with life. At the beginning of the
movie, Martin is shown emotionally stuck, especially in his role as a teacher. One scene that
clearly shows this is during his history class that he teaches around Video 1 around 8:30. In this
scene, Martin lectures in a dull, monotone way, and his students are visibly bored and frustrated.
Some of them even complain that he is a bad teacher. Martin barely reacts, which shows how
disconnected he feels. His lack of energy and confidence suggests that he is not only burned out
at work but also struggling personally.
Later in the film, Martin’s attitude shifts significantly. A strong change appears in the final scene
during the graduation celebration, around Video 4 at about 19:20-20:50. Here, Martin joins in the
celebration and dances with joy and freedom. This moment feels completely different from his
earlier behavior. He looks relaxed, confident, and genuinely happy. His movements are
expressive and carefree, showing us that he has reconnected with his emotions and the people
around him. This scene represents Martin finally letting go of his emotional restraint and
allowing himself to live in the moment.
The main insight Martin gains is that he has been living too cautiously and emotionally closed
off. Through the experiment, he realizes that his unhappiness was not just about alcohol levels,
but about losing passion, connection, and purpose in his life. While alcohol initially helps him
open up, the film makes it clear that it is not a long-term solution. This is especially shown
through the negative consequences of pushing the experiment too far, particularly with Tommy’s
storyline and passing.
Overall, the final message of the movie seems to be about balance and engagement with life.
Another Round suggests that while responsibility is important, life also requires risk, presence,
and being emotionally open. Martin’s growth shows that truly living means being willing to feel,
connect, and participate fully in life instead of simply going through the motions.",98,"Hi Isaiah, 

This is an outstanding essay. You selected the perfect scenes to illustrate Martin's transformation. 

Your analysis of the film's message is particulalry strong, especially your conclusion that truly living requires ""risk, presence, and being emotionally open.""

You mentioned that Martin was living ""too cautiously."" While fear is definitely part of it, consider if ""indifference"" or ""apathy"" is an even more precise descriptor for his state at the beginning.

Additionally, please proofread for minor grammar/phrasing (see attached comments to your submission).

Overall, great job on this! "
3,"In the movie Another Round, Martin's character arc over the course of the film takes him from being a lonely, introverted man who felt disconnected from most if not all of the things in his life and like he's become boring in his older age, to someone who has found a new appreciation for these things in the wake of losing/almost losing them. In video 1 at 6:31, the four friends we follow in the story are at a birthday party, and this is where we begin to see how Martin feels about his life and his marriage. He is brought to tears as he talks to his friends about how he feels like he rarely sees people and is distant from his wife. The film then shows how he uses alcohol to try and fix his problems. The interesting thing is that it almost worked for a time. It motivated Martin to plan a trip for his family where he was able to reconnect with his wife and have fun with his kids, and he was so content with that, that he almost quit the game there if not for the addictive nature of alcohol drawing him back in. The aftermath of that last drunken night out is what gives Martin the insight to finally stop. The public display made it obvious to all the men that they had a problem and they had to stop their experiment and deal with the fallout of their actions, whether it that be friction with spouses or trouble with work. I think Tommy specifically coming in to work drunk (film 3, 24:29) is what was a turning point for Martin since he was seeing their actions from an outside perspective and how negative the effects are. By the end of the movie, video 4 at 20 minutes, Martin and the others are still able to celebrate despite their losses and the recent rough patches of their lives because they appreciate what they have even more after having almost lost it, like Martin wanting to make things better with Anika and Nikolaj saying things are more connected with his family and all of them having fun at the graduation. I think overall, the final message of this film is about appreciating life and that regardless of the time that's past, it's never too late to start appreciating it again. ",99,"
Hi Alexandra, 

You did a good job identifying the birthday dinner as the key moment where we see Martin's unhappiness. Your observation that he felt ""disconnected"" is accurate.

For your next assignment, pay attention to little grammatical details, such as: 

""The film thens hows how he uses alcohol to try and fix..."" --> ""to try to fix""
""...that they had a problem and they had to stop..."" --> ""...that they had a problem, and they had to stop...""
""...the fallout of thier actions, whether it that be friction..."" --> ""whether that be""
""...that regardless of the time that's past"" --> ""that's passed""
Overall, great job! "
3,"In the movie Another Round it may seem as if drinking alcohol helped the characters’ lives
improve, but as the movie goes on it clearly reflects that it did not help with their problems.
The film reflects how alcohol brings out deeper issues and negative emotions. Based on
Martins character, the movie shows how real change does not come from drinking, it
comes from how a person chooses to face life and address their personal struggles.
At the beginning of the movie Martin is a teacher and his character is shown as depressed
and unmotivated (Video 3, 10-15minutes). In this scene before the drinking experiments
even begin Martin appears to be disconnected, tired and unhappy in his personal and
professional life. The student in his classroom starts to question his teaching because he
struggles to keep them engaged and seems very unsure of himself.
As the movie goes on you can start to see a change in Martin attitude when teaching he
seemed more confident and inspired (Video 3, 20-45 min). In this scene he is more energic
and engages with his students more. He is happier and more present in the classroom than
before. This scene shows his temporary sense of motivation.
Another scene is the graduation at the end of the movie when Martin joins in dancing and
celebrating (Video 3, 1 hour and 45 minutes). This scene shows that Martin has reached a
place where he feels more alive and open to life again despite the experiment causing
serious consequences.
Through this experience, Martin realizes that alcohol was never the real solution. He gained
the understanding he needed to engage with life. The final message that the movie portrays
is that growth comes from choosing to participate in life even when life becomes difficult
or uncertain.",80,"Hi Rajdai, 

You identified a strong final message that growth comes from ""choosing to participate in life even when life becomes difficult."" This aligns perfectly with the film's themes. 

However, you referenced ""Video3"" for scenes that happen at the very beginning of the movie. Please ensure you are referencing the correct video files in your timestamps. Additionally, to deepen your analysis, consider adding your interpretation of Martin's emotional change rather than just describing the scenes. For example, how exactly did he get more confident and inspired? Was it purely the alcohol, or was there something else? 

Lastly, please double-check your writing before submission. I left comments on your submission. 

Overall, good job! "
3,"At the beginning of the movie, Martin appears unmotivated until he and his friends decide to perform an experiment. His realization that he is unmotivated, depressed, and not as he used to be, though, comes up for the first time in 6:39 Video 1 when he asks his wife whether he is boring now, and she replies that he is not as he used to be when they first met. However, with the days of the experiment passing, Martin finds himself happy again. Specifically, in Video 2 at minute 9, is the first time he became happier and more enthusiastic in life, which can be noticed when he and his wife have their dinner together, just the two of them, and they are conversing and laughing with each other compared to how they used to have dinner before, in awkwardness and almost silence.

After a few days of the experiment, Martin’s confidence grows because the alcohol in his blood lets him be more open, which leads to respect from students and an improved relationship with his wife. But after the group of friends decides to take the experiment to another level, increasing the BAC from 0.5 to 1.0, Martin hits rock bottom with drinking too much, passing out outside, and his family confronting him, his wife leaving him, and the death of one of his best friends. This makes Martin realize that alcohol didn’t make his life better, it just masked his deeper struggles. Ultimately, during the final scenes, Martin realized that the issues cannot be fixed with a drink, and true fulfillment comes from accepting life’s uncertainty, pain, and joy without numbing them or trying to escape. This can be especially noticed during the final scenes starting at Video 4 at 10:15, with him celebrating the graduation, later on receiving a message from his wife, giving the hope that their relationship will be fixed, and him dancing by the water. The dance, seen in Video 4 at 20:27, is not an escape but rather an expression of acceptance and presence. His celebration is driven by his willingness to engage fully with his life and everything it offers.

The movie’s message is that alcohol can have both euphoric highs and destructive lows, as real life itself can be. Showing that it is necessary to embrace life’s unpredictability, joy, and sadness, even in its messy and imperfect moments.",99,"Hi Valeriia, 

This is an excellent essay. Your interpretation of the final dance is insightful and sophisticated. You argued that the dance is ""not an escape but rather an expression of acceptance and presence,"" which perfectly captures the film's message. 

A very minor technical clarification: You mentioned increasing BAC from ""0.5 to 1.0"". In the film, they use permille (‰), so 0.5‰ equals 0.05% BAC. Additionally, please pay attention to small grammatical details (e.g., ""Specifically, in Video 2 at minute 9, it is the first time..."").

Overall, excellent job!"
3,"Martin has never fully been present in his life. In the beginning of Another Round, Martin is shown to be depressed and unmotivated. A specific moment shown in the film that accompanies this statement is when Martin delivers a lecture in his history class. Martin doesn’t engage with the students during the lecture, sits at his desk the whole time, doesn’t smile at all, etc. (Video 1 at 5 min 2 seconds). While Martin and his friends experiment with drinking, Martin has a moment in the film where he engages with his students and the students are excited to learn. Martin is smiling, walking around the classroom, letting his students speak during his lecture (Video 2 at 21 min 5 seconds). Martin and his friends seem to see a positive change with drinking alcohol during the day. Although in the long run, one of his friends commits suicide due to drinking. This could have caused Martin to go back to being unmotivated and depressed, though since he gained insight during this experience that caused him to grow he continued to be happier. The insight that Martin gained was that life cannot be fully lived with emotional restraint. Intoxication allows him to learn what being happy feels like. In the long run, intoxication taught him that being fully present allows him to know what the true meaning of life is. The experiment shows him that he isn’t missing alcohol, he’s missing his courage and emotional honesty. Martin and his wife are able to be intimate due to this realization. The final message of Another Round is that alcohol is not the answer to the struggles that life can bring to an individual. When life is lived with caution, it can be equally as destructive as constantly consuming alcohol. The film encourages us to live life more fully with vulnerability, responsibility, and freedom as shown with Martin’s dance at the end of the film (Video 4 at 21 min 45 seconds). ",98,"Hi Angelina, 

This is an excellent essay. You've correctly identified the core message of the film. You also selected strong, contrasting scenes to illustrate Martin's transformation from a boring teacher to a dynamic educator.

For your next assignments, just watch out for the following areas: 

preposition (e.g., ""In the beginning of"" --> at)
punctuation (e.g., ""he engages with his students, and the students..."") 
Overall, excellent job! "
3,"At first glance, Another Round is a fascinating film. You begin watching it, thinking, ""Is there anything positive I will learn from this film?"" But as the film goes on, it becomes clear that the central message of the film, being in a constant but controlled stupor will benefit your life, is not sustainable. This message is conveyed mainly through Martin's transformation, which begins as personal and emotional stagnation and culminates in a completely new outlook on life.  

Early in the film, Martin seemed depressed but also detached from his career and family. Around 5:00 minutes, he struggles to lead his class through a lesson on Winston Churchill and appears mentally dissociated from both the material and his students. In fact, his lack of focus becomes so apparent that students begin correcting him on the lesson's historical details, most notably Malthe. This emotional detachment continues at home, where, at approximately 5:55, the film cuts to a solemn Martin. Although he is physically present at the table, you can tell Martin has completely given up on life. He barely engages in conversation with his wife or kids and appears emotionally distant. This scene establishes that Martin's depression is affecting all areas of his life.

A strong contrast happens later in the movie during the early stages of the alcohol experiment. Before entering his classroom, Martin tests his BAC (blood alcohol content) and reveals he is at a .047. Reflecting on what his group discussed, he is eager to see the effects. The camera then opens up to the classroom at around 1:03 in the second video, with Martin's demeanor toward his students changed. In the scene, Martin is much more relaxed, engaging with his students, and confident! He explains the lesson using an effective election metaphor, which gets many more students involved in the material.

The insight that allows Martin to grow is the realization that alcohol was never the true source of his confidence or his happiness. While the drinking lowered his anxiety and allowed him to reconnect to teaching, it created a nasty product in the end. The experiment revealed that all the qualities Martin thought he had lost were still inside him this whole time. By the end of the film, Martin realizes that real growth happens when you're actively engaged in life rather than escaping from it.",100,"Hi Daniel, 

This is a fantastic essay. You did a great job identifying Martin's initial state not just as ""sad,"" but as ""mentally disassociated"" and ""detached."" Also, your conclusion is a perfect summary of the film's existential theme. 

Excellent work. "
3,"The film “Another Round” explores the effects of alcohol on an individual's
self-confidence and perception of life. To do so, the film features Martin, a depressed
high school history teacher. In a transformation, Martin realizes that alcohol never truly
made him confident, but only created the illusion of change. An example of this
transformation is seen in video one at 6:09-6:53. This scene shows him being ignored
in the family dinner, and then transitions to him talking to his wife after an exhausting
day. Where students and parents complained about the way he teaches his classes. So
in search of comfort, Martin resorts to his wife in asking if she thinks he is boring. To
Martin’s surprise, she answers ""You're not the same Martin I first met”, further pushing
Martin into a deep depression on his life situation, where at home he is ignored by his
children, and unappreciated by his wife. Thus, he reflects his emotions with his
students, teaching without motivation, leading to a destructive cycle of depression. In
contrast, in video 4 at 18:15-23:37, Martin sends a text to his wife where he remembers
Tommy’s words and tells her that “Tommy was rooting for them”, and she replies “me
too”, symbolizing their eventual reconciliation as a couple. This chunk of the movie is
crucial for the film, as it shows the growth and development of all the friend groups,
especially Martin. As this scene takes on the aftermath of Martin’s alcoholism problem,
where in his anger he caused his wife to separate from him, and his students to lose
interest in his class again. However, this scene, marked by a text message to his wife
and the celebration with his students, shows that Martin realizes it was not the alcohol
that caused his transformation. But rather his motivation to break down the emotional
walls that kept him from facing the world around him. Thus, the film suggests how
alcohol breaks down those walls, however in the process, destroys everything around
us like relationships. And Martin realizes this once Tommy commits suicide, as this
event reveals to him that alcohol brings down everything, not caring for collateral
damage. Henceforth, through Martin’s transformation, the movie conveys to the
audience how having self-confidence and tearing down walls of trauma, shouldn’t be a
destructive process, but a slow and healthful journey that allows us to discover
ourselves and the joy of living.

Hi Sebastian, 

This is a very strong analysis. Your interpretation that the journey should be about ""tearing down walls of trauma"" rather than just using alcohol as a crutch is insightful. 

For your next assignments, please be consistent with citations. You switched between spelling out numbers (""video one"") and using digits (""video 4""). Pick one style and use it consistently. Additionally, be careful with run-on sentences and grammar errors. Check out the comments on your submission.

3,"In this film there is a visible change in Martin, this includes motivation, confidence, and his actions and morals overall. In video one at 5 minutes and 5 seconds Martin is teaching class and visibly unmotivated. He is talking about the lesson at a very low tone and very slow. The kids in the class also display this by showing the extreme boredom. In this scene a student even points out that Martin is not even staying on topic is this lesson and making the class more of a struggle. The following scene still in video one at 5 minutes and 55 seconds shows Martin eating dinner with his family and it seems awkward and silent. Anika, Martins wife, is forming small talk with the sons trying to have a conversation and not much is forming. Anika later tells Martin he is not the same as he used to be which might lead to the idea of him thinking he is boring now. Martin started becoming more motivated and confident in himself starting in video two at 1 minute and 50 seconds, He started being more enthusiastic with his teaching and being more involved. This made it easier for the students, and they later said that it allowed them to be ready for the exam because he had taught them everything. Martin seemed to try and put more effort into his family in video two at 23 minutes and 46 seconds booking a canoe trip and spending time with his family. Even though there were later issues with the marriage and Anika saying she waited too long and got with someone else, his effort was still there, and he was getting better and working to fix the marriage. I think Martin learned that it may not be the alcohol helping but the attitude you put toward trying to help. When he got more enthusiastic with teaching, the students became more involved and excited to learn. When Martin put more effort and love towards his marriage and family it was also reciprocated. The movies overall message may be that harmful substances such as alcohol does not fix your life, especially in a positive way, but your attitude and determination is what really has an effect on your life. You decide how you want to feel about your life and that is how it goes.",92,"
Hi Haley, 

You selected excellent scenes to contrast Martin's teaching style. Comparing the boring lecture in Video 1 with the enthusiastic lesson in Video 2 is the perfect way to show his initial transformation. 

However, your analysis of the film's message feels incomplete because you didn't address the final scene. You argued that the message is that ""you decide how you want to feel,"" but the film ends with a tragedy (Tommy's death) followed by a dance at the harbor. You need to incorporate these final scenes into your essay to fully answer the prompt. 

Additionally, please work on the following areas: 

punctuation (e.g., ""In this film there is..."" --> ""In this film, there is..."")
article (e.g., ""...Martin is teaching class..."" --> ""...Martin is teaching a class..."")
preposition (e.g., ""He is talking about the lesson at a very low tone"" --> ""He is talking about the lesson in a very low tone) 
word choice (e.g., ""...in a very low tone and very slow."" --> ""...in a very low tone and very slowly."") 
subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""...harmful substances such as alcodhol does not fix your life"" --> ""do not fix"") "
3,"Although the film Another Round takes place in Denmark the themes can easily be translated to
every culture. Another Round has a diverse plot structure and a variety of issues the characters
face but also makes it clear that the main commentary the filmmakers are trying to convey
pertains to alcohol abuse. Martin’s character prior to conducting the “experiment” with his
friends, is extremely relatable for most people, which I think is important for the movie, in its
entirety, to pack a punch with the audience. Video 1 at 14 minutes 26 seconds is a good depiction
of Martin’s current state of indifference. Even without any spoken lines, the viewer can
understand Martin’s feelings, or lack thereof towards himself, his teaching position, and his life
overall. I think there are a lot of different ways to interpret the sort of insight that Martin’s
character gains throughout the film, but for me I took away the theme that things can only get
better if you want them to. Before participating in the experiment, Martin is overwhelmingly
depressed and stagnant in his life, and at the time, drinking to boost his “confidence and
creativity” seems like an obvious solution to try out. However, once he develops a drinking
habit, his wife leaving him and straining his relationship with his kids serves as a wakeup call
that this is no way to live either. Martin getting sober, rededicating himself to teaching, and
mourning the loss of his friend Tommy is the beginning of him working towards a different
perspective of life. The scene of Martin dancing right before the credits may be an obvious
choice of his character’s more joyful self. However, I think that Video 4 at 18 minutes and 22
seconds, the scene with Martin texting Anika hinting at the possibility of getting back together, is
a much more subtle but just as important depiction of his character’s journey and ending.",92,"Hi Gwen, 

You correctly identified that Martin's initial problem was a total lack of feeling toward his own life. 

However, your analysis of the ending is a bit contradictory. You claim Martin finds a new perspective by ""getting sober,"" yet the movie ends with him drinking champagne and dancing wildly. If the message were strictly about sobriety, the director likely wouldn't have ended the film with a celebration involving alcohol. Addressing this nuance would have improved your essay. 

Additionally, please proofread for run-on sentences and minor grammar issues (see the attached comments on your submission). "
3,"There were a lot of scenes, especially in the beginning, where Martin was either depressed or extremely unmotivated and lethargic. One of those scenes started at the 6:30 mark of the movie where his partner Anika is leaving for work and he asks her if she thought he was boring. You can tell that for some reason he is lacking confidence and he knows that he needs to tighten up. Later on in the movie when him and his friends start consuming ridiculous amounts of alcohol, he undergoes a change that allows him to be more confident in what he says. You see this in one of my favorite parts of the movie at the 2 minute mark of the second part of the movie when he gives his students three options to choose from to vote for president. This scene showed that he actually had some charisma that had faded throughout the years. Moments like these throughout the movie show us that there were some really good effects of them drinking such as the improved teaching, but some really bad effects as well such as the family issues and suicide. I believe that the final message of the movie is that when it comes to drinking there is some good, but there is a lot of bad as well. We, as in the viewers, have to decide whether or not the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa. Another message is that drinking itself is not inherently bad, but excessive drinking is when some really bad problems start. I think this is also the insight that allowed Martin to grow throughout the movie. He went from not drinking at all, to excessively drinking. He has to find a medium, and so do we. I am not going to lie I really liked this movie and think that the message of drink in moderation can be applied to literally anything in life. Too much of anything can hurt you, so no matter what you do, do it in moderation.",90,"
Hi Caleb, 

You selected a scene that demonstrates Martin's return to confidence. 

However, your essay misses a key part of the analysis: the final scene. You concluded that the message is ""drink in moderation,"" but the movie ends with Martin drinking champagne and performing a wild, chaotic dance. If the message was simply moderation, the ending would likely look very different. Discussing that final dance would have added depth to your argument. 

Additionally, try to keep your tone more formal in future assignments (avoid phrases like ""you see,"" ""I am not going to lie,"" or ""tighten up""). Lastly, please pay attention to the following areas: 

punctuation (e.g., Anika is leaving for work, and he asks...)
pronoun usage (e.g., ""Later on in the movie, when he and his friends...)"
3,"I think the insight that allowed Martin to grow was discovering that not all problems can go away just by using alcohol. He was using it as a escape and when he first started, it was improving his mentality and his way of teaching. The way he was using alcohol wasn't in a bad way for any bad reasons, he just wanted to be less boring. It almost makes you feel really bad for the character because of the way that his story is brought up. Eventually with too much, as too much of anything can be overwhelming, he started to abuse the alcohol usage, making him more depressed and unable to perform the day to day tasks. His words would be slurring together in class, he even went to see how drunk he could get with his friends to reach the maximum alcohol volume which started the spiral. As seen for example in Video 3 17:09, his own son had to help take him home when he became too drunk, laying in the road in front of the wrong house, which aided in starting the whole divorce and split custody battle from what it seemed in the scene with him and his (ex) wife in the restaurant. I think the final message of the movie is to never take life for granted because eventually bad habits can catch up to you. When his friend died he started changing his life and encouraging the good behaviors that he should have had in the beginning. I think his final discovery at the end was that he has the positive mindset that everything is going to be okay, things might look up which is why he was dancing and having a good time with his friends and students at the end (Video 4 21:26).",94,"Hi Kathryn, 

You selected a very powerful scene to illustrate Martin's rock bottom moment, which perfectly captures the negative spiral of the experiment. 

To improve your analysis, look closer at the ending: Martin isn't just ""encouraging good behaviors."" He is drinking again. Discussing this would have deepened your essay. 

Additionally, please pay attention to the following areas: 

article usage (e.g., ""He was using it as an escape.."")
punctuation (e.g., ""...using alcohol wasn't in a bad way for any bad reasons; he just wanted to..."") 
verb form (e.g., ""...when he became too drunk, lying in the road..."") 
Overall, good work! "
3,"I think that Another Round was a pretty good film with an agreeable and straightforward story. It follows Martin, a teacher struggling with confidence, romance, and alcoholism. I think 2 scenes that show his growth throughout the film are the first dinner scene, and when he takes Tommy home. At 12:12 in the first video, Martin is meeting his friends at dinner for a birthday. They get drinks and discuss their 0.05% BAC hypothesis, as well as self-confidence. As Martin begins to drink and the conversation shifts towards his lack of self-confidence, he shows distance and often stares off while everyone talks. He continues drinking more and more until his friends ask what's up. He says he doesn't do much, see people often, has marriage struggles, and begins crying. In this scene, he shows a clear general distance in life, with hollow relationships and no confidence. He doesn't seem entirely motivated to fixing his marriage, since they had been through so much together. If we contrast this to 26:11 in the third video, when Tommy wakes up after being taken home by Martin, he shows a clear start to committment to betterment for both himself and those in his life. He cleans up Tommy's home and (presumably) made pasta for them. When Tommy tries to drink multiple times in the scene, Martin looks out for him by telling him to slow down and chill out. When Tommy gives him advice for his failing relationship with Anika, he seems receptive and willing to change. I think the contrast in the second scene shows that even though it may not be the most progress in the world, he is certainly working to better himself, and by virtue, those around him. I think the insight that Martin learns most through his journey in this movie is to face his problems head-on, rather than trying to avoid them through various means. Early on in the movie, it is clear that Martin was a man that had a lot of big things coming for him, but through one means or another he became a shell of himself, and it reflected in his life. He tries to address these problems indirectly through alcohol, before he finally decides to truly put in the work. The film is pretty explicit in its messaging, and I feel like that is to face problems head-on, and rely on others in your life.",94,"
Hi Levi, 

This is a very thoughtful essay. You chose a unique and effective contrast: comparing Martin's breakdown at the birthday dinner with the moment he steps up to take care of Tommy. Seeing Martin transition from the one needing help to the one providing care is a fantastic way to illustrate his growth. 

You concluded that Maritin learns to ""face problems head-on,"" but you did not mention the explosive dance at the end. Addressing why he drinks and dances at the end would have added nuance to your conclusion. 

Additionally, please pay attention to the following areas: 

subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""He says he doesn't do much, sees people..."") 
verb form (e.g., ""He doesn't seem entirely motivated to fix his marriage..."") 
spelling (e.g., commitment) 
pronoun usage (e.g., ""...Martin was a man who had a lot of..."") 
Overall, good work! "
3,"In the film Another Round, a scene that shows Martin being unmotivated is the scene where he is delivering his history lesson to his students (video 1 at 5 minutes ). Martin’s students are not paying attention, and he is simply reading from the textbook, going off topic seeming lost in what he is doing, having his students correct him about what they are supposed to be discussing. This scene is a clear example of how detached Martin is from his job, as well as his life; he seems to be doing it on autopilot, without any care or motivation. On the contrary, one scene that showcases Martin’s change and shows a different attitude towards life is the final scene where he is seen celebrating with the graduates, Martin begins dancing with joy in front of everyone (video 4 at 20 minutes 27 seconds). At this point, Martin’s attitude shows that he is no longer trying to escape from life but rather embracing it, it pinpoints that he has changed and no longer feels depressed. At that moment portrayed in the scene, Martin is genuinely happy for his students, proud of them, and emotionally touched by the text message from his wife, which brings a sense of hope and renewed connection to his personal life. I believe that the insight Martin gains that allows him to grow is understanding that alcohol is not the answer and was not the main contributor to things going “right” , but rather it was a catalyst that made him realize that he needed to make a choice to re-engage with life instead of trying it to mask his unhappiness with alcohol. Even though he is drinking in the final scene, it does not feel like he is trying to escape anything, and serves as a contrast to earlier moments where he drank to avoid reality and mask himself. Here, it represents celebration and freedom.  The film’s final message is about changing your attitude, and realizing that you could be seeing life differently, you can look at the greater things, instead of being focused on the bad.",99,"
Hi Brunna, 

This is an excellent essay. You correctly identified Martin's initial state of being indifferent. Your analysis of the ending is particulalry strong. 

For your next assignment, pay attention to the following areas:

3,"The main character, Martin appeared to be very sad even when doing the things that he once enjoyed.
This sadness began to get in the way of important things in his life, such as his relationships and his job.
One example of a time where Martin seemed to be depressed was when he was having dinner with his
friends at the beginning of the film. His expressions looked very solemn and he seemed to be dissociating
as he got lost in all of the noise and conversations between his friends (Video 1 at 19 minutes and 3
seconds). This was an important part of the film because this is the first time that Martin talked about his
feelings and accepted that there was something wrong. At this moment, he realized that he would need to
change something in his life in order to stop feeling so poorly. One example of a scene that showed
Martin happier and more inspired was when he lectured his students after he first started drinking a little
bit of alcohol each day (Video 2 at 23 minutes and 36 seconds).
I think Martin finally started to grow once he accepted that he had been struggling emotionally. In
addition to accepting that he was struggling to feel happy, he also started trying to live a more vibrant life
again (with some encouragement from his friends). When his friend died at the end of the movie, I think it
caused Martin to reflect on his previous choices and realize that excessively drinking wasn’t going to
improve his life or make him feel happier in the long term. At the end of the film, he confronts his
feelings by having a conversation with his wife and accepting his friend’s death. Though these things
were both painful it was important for him to work through the difficult moments instead of ignoring
them like he previously did. The final dancing scene showed him embracing his life and his feelings. I
think the final message is that it is important to experience your life and all of the feelings that come with
it, whether they are good or bad instead of trying to drown them out and ignore the root problems.
",97,"
Hi Mila, this is a very strong essay. I was particularly impressed by your use of the word ""dissociating"" to describe Martin’s state at the birthday dinner. That is a precise way to describe the apathy/indifference that plagues him at the beginning of the film.

You also did a great job connecting Tommy's death to Martin's realization. However, it's worth explicitly noting the irony that Martin is drinking during that final dance. He isn't fully sober, but he is using the alcohol differently—for celebration rather than escape. Acknowledging this complexity would have pushed the essay to a perfect score.

Lastly, please pay attention to small grammatical details (see attached comments to the submission). "
3,"The movie Another Round initially flirts with the idea that alcohol can help unlock a better version on oneself, the film gradually warps that fantasy into revealing the dark reality that alcohol can bring through Martin’s emotional arc. At the beginning of the movie, Martin is depressed and  unmotivated, demonstrated with his disinterest and confusion while teaching history. This is shown at 5:22 in the first video, where he mixes up the timeline of events and has to continuously regain his train of thought. He appears to be withdrawn, low-energy and disconnected to the point that students complain about his teaching. This moment establishes Martin as someone who has lost motivation for life, losing both passion and confidence in what he loves.   

Throughout the film, Martin undergoes a significant transformation that is showcased in the final scene of the film during the graduation celebration. 20:40 of the last clip showcases him breaking out into this uninhibited dance by the harbor and allowing himself to be free. This scene does not suggest that alcohol itself is the driving force behind his newfound charisma, but that he is reclaiming joy and expressing his emotions more openly. His carefree and expressive movements show that he is now willing to engage with life instead of observing it from a distance.  

This insight that Martin gains does not come from altering oneself with the crutch of alcohol, but from embracing risk, connection, and emotional honesty. Throughout the movie, Martin relies on alcohol to hone in on these qualities; at the beginning of group testing their theories, it showed how alcohol positively affected their moods and attention spans. However, the continued use of alcohol exposed how fragile and dangerous avoiding one’s problems can be when using alcohol to escape from reality. The death of Tommy underscores this reality, showcasing how alcohol can intensify despair instead of curing it. 

Overall, the film’s message is not about promoting or banning alcohol, but more so about balancing oneself and having the courage to face one’s problems head-on. The movie suggests that to live life to the fullest, one must be intentional about their decisions and vulnerable to the world. Martin’s growth comes from leaning to live life more boldly without relying on the crutch of alcohol, and that others have the capability to do so as well.  ",97,"Hi Jana, 

Great job on this. I particularly loved your conclusion that the message isn't about ""promoting or banning alcohol,"" but about ""being intentional."" 

Your essay contains some phrasing errors. For your next assignments, please take a moment to proofread for the following areas: 

preposition (e.g., ""a better version of oneself"")
conjunction (e.g., ""The movie...oneself, but the film gradually..."") 
spacing (e.g., remove the redundant space between ""and"" and ""unmotivated."")
comma (e.g., ""...low-energy, and disconnected..."")
Overall, great job!"
3,"At the beginning of the movie Another Round, the main character Martin is visibly
depressed and lacks self esteem. This is clear when Martin asks his wife, Anika, if he has
become boring compared to when he was younger (Video 1, 06:30). By asking this question, it
seems that Martin is looking for reassurance from his wife in order to feel more secure in
himself. Another example of Martin’s depression occurs when he goes out to dinner with his
friends for Nikolaj’s fortieth birthday (Video 1, 13:42). While at dinner, Martin breaks down
crying in front of his friends and explains that he is upset because he does not get to see his
friends or family often. This scene is important to understanding Martin’s struggles because it
shows that part of the reason he feels so down is due to deep loneliness.
During this dinner scene, Martin is intoxicated. He initially refuses to drink alcohol but
eventually gives in to the peer pressure (Video 1, 17:00). Once Martin starts drinking, it becomes
clear that he struggles with self control. He quickly goes from refusing drinks to finishing them
back to back. His drinking continues after the party, and the following morning Martin goes to
work visibly upset. He enters the bathroom and drinks alcohol before teaching (Video 1, 25:00).
Despite being under the influence, Martin delivers a fun and engaging history lesson
where his students appear interested and involved (Video 2, 03:30). He seems passionate, happy,
and excited to teach. This is very different from his typical unenthusiastic lessons. Martin and his
friends then decide to participate in an experiment where they aim to stay 0.05% intoxicated
during the workday to prove the theory that men have an alcohol deficiency. As the experiment
continues, Martin experiences both highs and lows. While drinking, he becomes more motivated
Jihye Kim

at work and puts effort into improving his strained family relationships. An example of this is the
canoeing trip with his family, where everyone appears relaxed and genuinely happy together
(Video 3, 01:07). However, Martin also experiences serious negative effects from his alcohol
intake, including loss of control over his body and judgment. One night, his drinking became so
bad that his son found him unconscious with a head injury in the street the morning after (Video
3, 19:30).
I believe Martin realizes that his relationships with his family, friends, and students are
strained at the beginning of the film. He craves human connection and expresses feelings of
loneliness throughout the film, but his depression and anxiety prevent him from making positive
changes. Alcohol temporarily gives him confidence and motivation, but it also brings
destruction. Seeing the harm alcohol causes helps Martin recognize that alcohol is not the
solution to his problems. Ultimately, Martin learns that he does not need alcohol to feel happy
and connected with his loved ones. The final message of the film suggests that fulfillment does
not come from substance abuse, but from great human connections.",90,"Hi Grace, 

You did an excellent job tracking Martin's emotional arc. Your scene selection was strong.

However, your essay is over the word count limit. This happened because you spent too much space summarizing the plot rather than analyzing it. Additionally, you argued that Martin learns he ""does not need alcohol,"" but he is clearly drinking in the final scene. Addressing that contradiction is key to understanding the film's complex message. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"At the start of the film, it was visible that Martin was unmotivated and depressed,
(Video 1, 6 minutes: 38 seconds). In this scene Martin asks his wife if “he is boring?”,
she answers that he isn’t the same man she met before. Martin asking this question
showed his vulnerability and self-doubt, which is later emphasized (Video 1, 10
minutes:14 seconds) when Martin tries to talk with his wife regarding his job issues
but once the kids interrupt them, he backs down without any discussion of the
problem. In contrast, later in the film when he drinks his attitude changes into a more
proactive one. He asks his wife to go canoeing during fall vacation, like they did 8
years ago, instead of staying inside the house (Video 2, 9 minutes: 20seconds). Later
in the film he follows through with this plan by booking the canoeing trip after
increasing his alcohol intake to 1.2 (Video 2, 23 minutes: 47 seconds).
I think that Martin gains the insight that he can live life without the influence of alcohol
and that it affected the relationships he cherished the most. I think this insight started
in Video 3, 29 minutes: 5 seconds, when Martin went to Tommy’s house and took care
of the dishes, food and the dog. Tommy said he was rooting for “You and Anika” and
that Martin should hold his head high like his old self. I believe this reminded Martin of
how he was in the past and that he could be happy and have a positive attitude even
without alcohol. Therefore, allowing him to encourage his students for exams without
drinking alcohol and still celebrating with them. Overall, the final message of the film
might be that people should cherish personal relationships without the influence of
addicting things like alcohol or drugs. However, the movie also shows that in
moderation and control alcohol can help people like how it helped the student with
his presentation and how the graduating class celebrated their test results.
Emphasizing a final message that people should have a positive attitude towards life
that contains balance between their personal relationships, goals and fun.
",97,"Hi Elena,

You selected excellent scenes to illustrate Martin's transformation. The contrast between his inability to talk to Anika and his proactive planning of the canoe trip effectively demonstrates how the alcohol initially ""woke him up.""

You concluded that the final message is about ""balance,"" which is a strong argument, but analyzing the visual scene (i.e., Martin's dance) would have deepened your analysis.

Finally, please pay attention to the small grammar details (see attached comments on your submission)."
3,"At first, Another Round makes it seem like drinking alcohol might help improve life.
However, it quickly becomes clear that alcohol is not a long-term solution. While drinking
makes the characters feel more confident and motivated at first, it eventually increases their
emotional struggles. This is most clearly shown through the death of one character, which
highlights how alcohol can deepen sadness and depression rather than fix it. Even though the
film does not end with a traditional happy ending, Martin still goes through an important
personal change.
Early in the film, Martin appears depressed and unmotivated. This is shown in the
classroom scene around 12–15 minutes, when students complain that he is boring and
disconnected. Martin looks tired, uninterested, and emotionally distant, showing that he has lost
passion for both teaching and life. Another moment that shows his unhappiness is his birthday
dinner (around 18 minutes), where he refuses to dance and avoids having fun, suggesting he has
closed himself off from joy.
By the end of the film, Martin’s attitude has changed. This is most clear in the final scene
at the graduation celebration (around 1 hour and 46 minutes). Martin joins the students and
dances freely. Unlike earlier moments, this happiness does not feel forced or controlled. Instead,
it shows someone who has let go of fear and is willing to fully participate in life.
The insight Martin gains is that alcohol is not what makes life meaningful. Drinking only
temporarily covered up his deeper problems. What he really needed was connection, purpose,
and the courage to take emotional risks. The final message of the film suggests that life cannot be
controlled or perfected, but it can be lived fully if one is willing to be present, open, and
engaged—even when the future is uncertain.",96,"Hi Mirel, 

You structured this essay very well by focusing on the motif of dancing. Your conclusion is a sophisticated interpretation of the film's theme. 

However, your essay itself is slightly under the word count (298 words), and your descriptions are sometimes a bit general. For example, when you mention ""the death of one character,"" name him and explain specifically how the death impacted Martin's final decision to dance. 

Overall, great job! "
3,"A clear example of Martin's depression appears in Video 3 at about 16:40. In this scene,
Martin is shown lying on the floor with a bloody head after a night of heavy drinking. His son
Jonas has to help him inside the house. When Martin explains what happened at dinner, everyone
is disappointed in him. His wife becomes extremely upset and leaves the house, which pushes
him further into a downward spiral into more drinking. This moment shows how alcohol has not
improved his life but instead made his problems worse especially with his family. He feels
ashamed and isolated, and his drinking increases as he tries to escape these feelings.
Later in the film, Martin shows a change in attitude. This can be seen in Video 4 at
around 19:00 during the celebration with his students and friends after the exams. In this scene,
Martin appears more relaxed and joyful. He dances and laughs with the people around him
despite the funeral that just happened. Even though alcohol is still present, the focus of the scene
is not just on drinking but on Martin reconnecting his students. This emotion change is a huge
contrast to everything that was happening beforehand.
The insight Martin gains is that alcohol itself is not the solution to his unhappiness. At
first, he believes that drinking will make him a better teacher, husband, and friend. Over time he
realizes that it only temporarily hides his problems and can deepen his depression, as seen in the
death of his friend Tommy. His growth comes from accepting uncertainty and allowing himself
to feel joy again without depending on alcohol as a crutch.
I believe the final message of the movie seems to be that life should be lived with
openness and courage. Happiness does not come from constant control or from numbing pain
with substances. Instead, it comes from hanging out with friends, doing things you love and
enjoy, and being present in the moment.",97,"
Hi Matteo, 

You selected a compelling scene to illustrate the consequences of Martin's drinking.

However, to show character growth, it is worth establishing who he was at the start (Video 1). Additionally, please proofread for minor grammar issues (see attached comments to your submission). 

Overall, great job! "
3,"At the start of the movie, Another Round suggests that drinking alcohol can improve one’s
quality of life by increasing confidence, sociability, and motivation. Early in the film, starting in
Video 1, at approximately 5 minutes, Martin is clearly depressed and disengaged from both his
work and personal life. In the scene, Martin is in the classroom presenting his lecture in a flat,
monotone voice; it seems as if he doesn’t know what he’s teaching. He receives criticism from
his students and their parents for being uninspiring and for giving them the feeling that he does
not care about them or the exam they must pass to graduate. At home, his emotional distance
from his wife and children further emphasizes his sense of depression and dissatisfaction.
As the experiment on the effects of alcohol begins, Martin’s demeanor noticeably changes. One
scene showing his more motivated and joyful attitude occurs in Video 2, at about 1 minute and
55 seconds. In this scene, Martin is just under 0.5% BAC and seems to be more animated and
energized while teaching. He also happens to get his students engaged in his discussion, and they
respond positively, supporting the idea that alcohol is the source of his improvement. However,
the film starts to reveal that alcohol only temporarily masks emotional struggles rather than
resolving them.
Ultimately, the death of Tommy made Martin realize that he needed to face the consequences of
avoiding pain rather than addressing it. He also realized that to fully engage with life, he needed
to be vulnerable and present. The last scene of the film, at the graduation celebration (Video 4,
20:27), captures this realization as Martin’s dance reflects a release rather than an escape. It
suggests that he’s willing to participate in life, regardless of risk or outcome. Martin’s
transformation is not about how much he drinks, but about rediscovering who he is and his
ability to feel, engage, and take emotional risks. This enforces the overall message of the film
that while external substances, like alcohol, may briefly increase joy or confidence, true growth
comes from within.",100,"
Hi Ta'Niyah, 

This is an excellent essay. You seamlessly integrated the specific scenes with the broader themes of the movie. 

I particularly appreciated your interpretation of the final dance. 

One small technical note for future reference: In the film, they use per mille (‰), so 0.5‰ equals 0.05% BAC."
3," found the film Another Round very polarizing. Watching the main character
development throughout the movie was very enjoyable and touching. Martin at the beginning
seems very distraught struggling with his family life and mental health. I believe that one of the
clearest and earliest moments of this is at 19 minutes in the first clip of the movie. He goes on to
talk about his difficulties with his wife that has been going out at night. He is visibility upset
about this and says, “I don’t know how I ended up like this.” This really shows his mental state
in the moment. His mental struggles and difficulties in his day-to-day life ultimately leads to his
alcoholism. Martin then proceeds to essentially experiment with different amounts of alcohol
during the school day to see its effects with his close friends. He appears to gain momentary
happiness and relief in his everyday life. He makes his lessons more exciting, starts hanging out
with his friends more, and talks to his family more.
I believe the key turning point for Martin is at around 2 minutes in the third clip. Martin
is seen canoeing with his family. Laughing, playing, and setting up a campsite with them. His
wife cried during an intimate moment with them saying she really missed him. This was an
extremely important moment for Martin as it showed him how his loved ones still really cared
for him. The critical part of this scene was that Martin was completely sober, and this scene
seems to be one where he is most joyous besides the final scenes of the film. This had to have
shown Martin the light in a sense; a world where he could be happy with his family without the

need of a substance. He of course then abuses alcohol even further with his friends later in the
movie until the final moments of the film where everyone stops drinking so much and focuses on
what they find most important in their lives",93,"Hi Daniel, 

You selected a great opening scene to establish Martin's initial distress. 

However, your analysis of the ending needs more depth. The movie ends with Martin drinking champagne and performing a chaotic dance. Including an analysis of this contradiction with sobriety would have strengthened your argument. 

Additionally, please double-check your grammar (see the attached comments to your submission).

Overall, good work! "
3,"Starting at 22:28 in video 3, Martin is shown to be physically weak, with bags under his eyes and a red coloring around his cheeks. His facial expressions reveal that he is questioning whether the experiment that he and his friends have been conducting was worth it after all. Initially, he believed that alcohol would not be a problem that interferes with his life. But at this point, he has come to understand that there are consequences associated with the abuse of alcohol. Martin decides to make a change in his life and at 20:05 in video 4, we can see that he has shifted physically and mentally. He appears healthier and actively shows happiness while dancing with his friends and students. After facing all these problems due to alcohol, he has come to a better relationship with himself, as he starts to understand how to take care of himself and drink in moderation. The insight that Martin gains is his understanding that alcohol is not the answer to his problems. Whenever a problem was presented to him, he simply drank alcohol to avoid it. When he was drinking, he felt as if he was able to be his true self around people while he was under the influence. When Tommy passes away, Martin comes to fully understand that his thinking was entirely wrong. His death reveals to Martin that he needs to face the consequences of alcohol, while also revealing that it will never be a solution to the problems that he faces but instead will be a shield that harms him more than anything. In my eyes, the final message of the film revolves around taking control of your life instead of letting it go on auto pilot. The film demonstrates that people tend to live their lives without putting in much of their own input, which leads to problematic routes in life. Martin breaks this cycle once he realizes the harm that alcohol has brought to his own life. And his dancing in the final scene shows that he decided to involve himself with his life instead of remaining stagnant. Overall, the film’s message is all about encouraging people to actively engage with their lives instead of sitting around and letting time pass with no interaction. ",96,"Hi Nicholas, 

Great job identifying the film's core message. Your argument that the final dance represents him ""involving himself with his life"" is excellent. 

However, you started your essay with Video 3. To show true character growth, it is helpful to compare the beginning (Video 1, where he is indifferent) to the end. That way, you can also discuss why he started drinking in the first place. 

Additionally, be careful with run-on sentences. 

Overall, great job! "
3,"The film, Another Round, depicts a group of teachers who are friends that decide to
partake in a drinking experiment to test a theory. As they undergo the experiment, they test
the limits of their abilities to handle such frequent drinking at high amounts. Through the
storyline the themes of substance abuse, depression, death, and finding contentment are
addressed.
The main character, Martin, is introduced as someone who’s life is underwhelming.
The lack of joy in his day-to-day experiences affects different realms of his life, including
occupational, romantic, and social. As Martin is leaving to go to Nikolaj’s birthday dinner,
he looks at his children who seem disinterested that he is leaving and focus only on the TV
(Video 1, 11 min 12 seconds). This reaction and the one he had from his wife when he
asked if she found him boring both discourage him and make him feel insignificant (Video
1, 6 min 35 seconds).
After hearing from his friend that there is a theory that humans are born with a
0.05% BAC deficiency and that drinking to reach and maintain this level could increase
creativity and relax an individual, he decides to try it at work. The positive effect it had on
Martin can be seen while he teaches his students about Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler,
and does so through an interactive method that the students have a great reaction to
(Video 2, 3 min 28 seconds).
However, while it seemed to improve their quality of life for a period, the drinking
began to do more damage than good. They eventually conclude the experiment on the
claims that it had severe negative effects and made them prone to alcoholism. This alludes
to the message of the movie that humans cannot rely on any one thing to be their source of
joy in life. One should look for it in all their experiences, even mundane ones. At the end of
the movie, the group of men have drinks with their students, but it is not in attempt to get
through the day, instead it is in addition to their celebrations and festivities. As for Martin,
the insight that he gains seems to be that changes in life or in a person, and aging are
inevitable experiences that should be relished, not feared.",96,"Hi Sophie, 

This is a very strong essay. You did an excellent job establishing Martin's initial isolation. I also really appreciated your distinction in the conclusion that, at the end, the alcohol is ""in addition to their celebration"" rather than a tool to get through the day."" 

To make your essay even stronger, include the final dance in your analysis. You mention ""relishing"" life, and Martin's dance at the harbor is the physical embodiment of that idea. 

Lastly, please proofread for grammar (see the attached comments on your submission). 

Overall, great job! "
3,"I think the insight Martin gains, which allows him to transform and grow as a person, is to enjoy the life he has. Although the film shows the detriments of the experiment the men were partaking in, it also shows the benefits of their friendship. A big reason why Martin was so depressed at the beginning of the film was his lack of joy. He felt lonely and isolated, as shown by the differing schedules with his wife and the fact that no one in his family had cared enough to know he was going out. The film also hinted that going out with his friends was rare. He lost his spark for teaching, and it was apparent to his class and their parents. This can be seen in Video 1 at 5 mins 46 secs, where Martin is introducing Winston Churchill to his students. Because of his monotonous, lackluster tone, his students are having trouble grasping the information he is giving. This moment is representative of his life at the time. He has lost interest in most aspects of his life, including teaching, friends, and family; in turn, they have all lost interest in him. This all changes when he begins drinking and finds his everyday, once-trivial pursuits now fun and engaging. In Video 2 at 20 min 16 seconds, Martin reintroduces Winston Churchill to his students, but this time he uses a fact about Churchill’s life that he finds interesting, drawing on his passion and resonance to better engage his students. As the movie progresses, he shows more attention to his wife, more notice of his sons, and spends more time with his friends. The movie depicts the trajectory of his life as getting better with the more love and joy he allows himself, and that the alcohol is simply what gives him that push to allow it. This leads me to believe that the final message of Another Round was that happiness is not found in alcohol, but rather in finding joy, laughter, and love in those around you.",95,"Hi Mia, 

Great job on this. You made the perfect comparison by contrasting the two Churchill lectures. Your analysis of the ""trajectory of this life"" is also very strong. 

In your conclusion, you wrote that happiness isn't found in alcohol, which is true, but Martin is drinking in that final scene. Discussing that contradiction adds the final layer of depth to the analysis. 

Overall, great job! "
3,"The film Another Round portrays various attitudes towards life and living, which affect the main character, Martin, and his colleagues. There are scenes that illustrate Martin’s life to be predictable and withdrawn, with nothing to look forward to. The film documents Martin’s journey with alcoholism and depression as well as his transformation back into a new, awakened life. In the first video, at 19 minutes and 15 seconds, at the birthday dinner for his friend Nikolaj, Martin breaks down emotionally and says, “I don’t do much. I don’t see many people…She (his wife) works nights a lot, so I don’t see her much either.” He admits how unhappy and distanced he feels from life, expressing a clear notion of being depressed and unmotivated, perhaps experiencing a midlife crisis. As the drinking experiment begins, Martin and his colleagues begin to drink daily to maintain a certain level of intoxication. The experiment initially offers Martin spontaneity and emotional openness, giving him a glimpse of who he once was. However, scenes of them drinking in school bathrooms, locker rooms, and even offering alcohol to students indicate a loss of control. Additionally, Martin faces the reality of his relationship with his wife, discovering ongoing infidelity due to his emotional absence and isolation. His state worsens as he moves out and faces life among his friends and alcohol. Ultimately, Martin faces the death of a friend, giving him the insight needed to grow and reflect on the value of life and living. In the fourth video, at 18 minutes and 45 seconds, in the harbor celebration scene, Martin receives a text message from his wife hinting at reconciliation. Here, he displays a slight smile and joins the celebration by dancing fearlessly among his friends and graduate students. The background music sings, “What a life, what a night, what a beautiful, beautiful ride… don’t want to worry ‘bout a thing, but it makes me terrified to be on the other side, how long before I go insane?” This upbeat and euphoric song embraces the messy and intense moments of life, advising to take it as it is and choose to feel rather than be closed off from it all. Even as Martin is scared to fall back into his old lifestyle, he chooses to recognize that his life is worth living even when it is unpredictable and painful.",100,"Hi Katarzyna, 

Excellent job on this. Your analysis of the song's lyrics was a brilliant move. Your conclusion is an accurate summary of the film's existential message. 

Excellent job. "
3,"Despite the film, Another Round, initial positive view on alcohol, the perspective shifts as the characters' lives are affected. The theme demonstrates a stark contrast as the film progresses. This is evident for Martin, where he is initially depressed in both settings- his school job and at home with his wife. 6 minutes and 37 seconds into the film, Martin asks his wife whether she finds him boring or not. Then, Anika reveals that he is dissimilar to the “old-version” when he was younger. This observation is a reflection of his disinterest in everyday life events. Thus, Anika confesses that Martin is dull and lacks the interest that was more noticeable when Martin was more youthful. However, the introduction of alcoholism into his routine changed his personality. This is especially prominent in the family trip scene. His relationship with his wife is completely transformed by the influence of the introduction of an increased alcohol consumption. In video 3 at 3 minutes and 33 seconds, Anika changes her viewpoint that was established prior. Additionally, this change reveals Martin’s state of a more inspired attitude. The dynamic shift results because of Martin’s higher alcohol consumption, causing his improved mood. Furthermore, the insight Martin gains that allows him to grow was evident in the scene before Tommy’s death. After Tommy was affected by excessive alcohol intake in his work life, he gives Martin meaningful advice on improving his life and relationships. And, once Tommy is deceased, the advice becomes even more significant toward not only Martin’s personal growth but also in his relationship with Anika. The message of Another Round is displayed in the relationship between Anika and Martin, consequently revealing a more practical attitude toward life and living. This is demonstrated through exercising tastes and preferences in moderation without a complete dependence.",93,"Hi Ryan, 

You selected two excellent scenes to contrast Martin's life. This effectively demonstrates how the alcohol initially repaired his relationship with Anika. 

However, you argue for ""moderation,"" but you didn't mention Martin's final dance. In that scene, he is letting go of control entirely while drinking alcohol. Discussing why he chooses to drink and dance at the end is crucial to understanding the film's complex message about acceptance. 

Additionally, please proofread your essay for the following areas: 

possessive markers (e.g., Despite the film Another Round's initial positive...)
preposition (e.g., The dynamic shift results from Martin's) 
verb from (e.g., ...intake in his work life, he gave Martin...) 
article usage (e.g., in moderation without complete dependence). "
3,"A scene in the film where Martin seems unmotivated and distant is when he is at his friend's birthday dinner. In this scene, Martin seems almost disconnected from what’s happening at the table. His friends continue to talk while he just sits there and stares, as if he’s contemplating everything that has led him up to where he is in his life currently and the emptiness he is feeling. He then takes a drink of his alcohol to comfort and make himself feel better (Video 1 at 17 min 0 seconds). This scene is significant because it sets the tone for the beginning of his tumultuous relationship with alcohol and binge-drinking in search of feeling excitement in his life again. In contrast, a scene in the movie where Martin is perceptively happier and changed is in the final scene. In this scene, Martin and his friends are celebrating the new graduating students, and all of a sudden, he begins to dance with no inhibitions (Video 4 at 21 min 7 seconds). In the film, we learn that Martin used to dance as a teenager, so I think this scene symbolizes his reconnection with his younger self and his decision to embrace life even if he doesn't know what path lies ahead, hence the ending where he jumps freely into the ocean (Video 4 at 22 min 29 seconds).

The insight that Martin gains that allows him to grow is that by the end of the experiment, Martin and his friends realize the negative effects that the alcohol experiment has had on their personal lives and the dangers of continuing the experiment, resulting in them stopping. Moreover,  the death of his best friend, Tommy, who died as a result of his drinking, also makes Martin reflect on how short life is and how important it is to cherish the people we care about. This helps give Martin the courage to fight for his marriage. This brings me to the final message of the movie regarding one’s attitude towards living, which is that it should not be taken for granted. For example, the high school students are carefree; they are not worried about the future ahead and choose to remain in the present moment. Although they may find themselves in the position that Martin and their friends are in, there is no way to know for certain what the future holds.",99,"Hi Alejandra, 

Great job on this. Your interpretation of the final freeze-frame is excellent. Describing it as a decision to ""embrace life even if he doesn't know what path lies ahead"" perfectly captures the ambiguity and hope of that final shot. 

You stated that the result of the experiment was ""them stopping."" While they stop the formal experiment, Martin is clearly drinking alcohol in the final scene. It's important to note that the lesson isn't necessarily total abstinence, but rather a shift in why he drinks.

Overall, excellent job! "
3,"I feel that if I we to pick a scene within this film that would showcase the main character - Martin - as depressed or overall unmotivated, 6:25 in the first video is what I believe to be the best showcase of this. In this scene, Martin is overall very somber. He is at a stage in his life where he has made most of the large decisions within his life - now contemplating whether they were good or the right ones. While in this state, he proceeds to ask his wife if he has grown boring over the years they have been together. After stating that he has changed, she leaves. His question likely stems from a belief that his past self lived a ""better"" life than the one he lives in today. Many different cases of depression stems from a longing or comparing one's self to the past. Many people view the past with a lense of nostalgia, seeing events that were - in the moment - bad as funny. What many don't remember is all of the poor choices made or bad actions that did occur, as to reminisce is to lie to one's self. At the very end of the film - video number four at 21:10 - a large party is seen. The main character - Martin - has, at least what he sees as, an incredibly joyous event. He parties and drinks with his students as they celebrate. He even decides to dance, though he claimed earlier in the film that he could not due to injury. This moment in the film reflects the good that he would have perceived in the past, that being a short moment of great fun and excitement. This moment ignores the outside world and focuses on just the fun. I believe this is the perfect world for Martin and Martin alone. ",91,"Hi Christian, 

You introduced a very interesting concept: nostalgia as a trap. You correctly identified that he was idealizing a past that maybe wasn't as perfect as he remembers. 

However, your argument should be grounded in evidence. In the final scene, Martin is dancing on the harbor right after his best friend's funeral; he isn't ignoring the pain, he is choosing to embrace the ""spark"" of life despite the pain. Exploring that contradiction would have added more depth to your final paragraph. 

Additionally, there are several typos and phrasing errors. 

Overall, good job! "
3,"Throughout Another Round, we watch as the main character, Martin,
experiments with consuming more and more alcohol in an attempt to regain the
liveliness and confidence he once had as a young man. Before the start of this
experiment, Martin is simply going through the motions, perfunctorily performing his
duties required by his family and his job. This is especially clear at minute 5:00, when
Martin is lecturing to his class in a monotonous manner, he trails off from his initial
points and has to be corrected by his students, who are less than pleased with his
passionless teaching methods. As he begins drinking on the job, Martin transforms into
a completely new person. This evolution is illustrated best by minute 49:45, when
Martin engages the class in a passionate discussion about alcohol consumption,
connecting similarities between the students’ use and the use of famous historical
figures. Martin’s newfound, and borderline obsession, with drinking seems to pervade
his teaching, with each lesson having explicit ties to excessive alcohol use. Martin begins
taking a more involved approach to teaching, seeking common ground with his students
to reach them better, and, as a result, feels more fulfilled by his profession.
While initially it may seem like the drinking has fostered this change of spirit
within Martin, it is less about the alcohol itself and more about what it has enabled him
to do. Before this experiment, Martin was a passive participant in his life, and he feels he
has lost all drive, not just career-wise but within his relationships. The constant drinking

limits his inhibitions, and he allows himself to engage with life and others in ways he
never had before. As the film progresses, Martin recognizes thatit is not the alcohol that
has helped him become more present; it is the way he has actively chosen to start living,
to start finding happiness in his day-to-day life and his personal relationships. Overall,
the message Another Round wants its viewers to take away is that life is what you make
of it. It is up to you to seek out the joy in life, to take charge, and to find the meaning in
the mundane. Life is worth living, but only if you make it so.
",95,"Hi Gray, 

This is a strong analysis. You did a great job contrasting the two classroom scenes. Showing how his teaching style shifted from ""monotonous"" to ""passionate"" is the best way to track the experiment's initial success. 

You argue that Martin learns to ""find happiness in his day-to-day life,"" which is true, but the film ends with a tragedy (Tommy's death) followed by a chaotic celebration. Addressing how Martin reconciles that grief with the joy of the final dance would have added the necessary depth to your conclusion. 

Lastly, be careful with small typos and run-on sentences. 

Overall, great job! "
3,"At the beginning of Another Round, you can sense and feel the portrayal of Martin as
depressed, disengaged, and even his lack of purpose both personally and professionally. One
scene in the film that occurs early in the film that demonstrated this portrayal in during one of
Martin’s history classes (Video 1 at about 14 minutes). Martin is obviously disorganized and
doesn’t connect with students, reading straight from his notes. As his body language is observed
he appears to be very closed off, the students are very obviously and understandably bored and
somewhat confused which illustrates how Martin has fallen from the teacher he used to be. This
continues outside of the classroom and at his home where his marriage appears to be very routine
like and distant. He appears emotionally numb.
Once the experiment with alcohol has begun you can sense a temporary boost in Martins
engagement and even his confidence. However, this is clearly not a solution that is sustainable.
Tommy’s death marks a turning point in the film; it emphasized that sadness could intensify
while drinking. Martin then is forced to confront the consequences of his avoidance.
A contrast that is powerful in the film is the final scene of the film, during the graduation
scene (Video 2 at 1 hour and 55 minutes). In this scene Martin appears out of his depression,
joining in with the crowd and breaking into an uninhibited dance. He appears very expressive
and extremely joyful which symbolizes a sense of freedom as opposed to control. His happiness
seems genuine instead of forced contrasting earlier scenes of the film. Martin seems to have a
new willingness to fully engage with life again.
The key insight gained by Martin was that life cannot and is not optimized through
control, this is whether through calculated intoxication or sobriety. Fulfillment in life rather
comes from embracing presence, passion, and vulnerability. The final message that comes across
in the film is that alcohol is a temporary solution but leads nowhere, instead growth comes from
relationships, courage, and purpose. This film encourages its viewers to reflect on self-awareness
and the understanding and important of choosing life even despite risks.",85,"Hi Lainey, 

You wrote a great thematic summary of the film. You correctly identified that Martin's problem wasn't sadness but a desire for control. 

However, be careful with your citations. You referred to the final graduation scene as Video 2, but it appears in Video 4 (starting at 18 minutes). Additionally, try to reconcile your conclusion with the fact that Martin is drinking in the final shot; that would add depth to your analysis. 

Lastly, please proofread for grammar. I've left comments directly on your submission. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"Drinking is an extremely addictive habit that many fall into whether it's being
introduced to it at a young age, or going through a hard moment in your life where you
need to find a way to forget about everything and relax. In Another Round, at the
beginning of the film we see that Martin is going through a tough life. He isn’t having
much enjoyment teaching, he doesn’t have a passionate relationship with his life, and
overall he believes he has become boring. His depression is not presented as a result of
one single event, but rather as a slow erosion of meaning, confidence, and emotional
engagement. A scene that demonstrates his depression would be at the very beginning at
4 minutes and 55 seconds. This scene shows his lack of passion for his profession and
how disconnected he is with his students and job. Additionally, at 6 minutes and 35
seconds, he asks his wife if he has become bored, this question further unraveles the
depression he has been feeling inside.
The film then turns into an alcohol experiment amongst four teachers, Martin included.
While alcohol is framed as dangerous as shown at the beginning of the first clip up to 3
minutes and 30 seconds where the student had gotten so out of control the consumption
of alcohol had to be banned during that semester. It functions as a tool that lowers
Martin's defenses, meaning under the influence he becomes more expressive, a more
energetic and dynamic teacher, and finds the missing passion with his wife again. An
example of where Martin shows a transformation is in the second clip at 19 minutes and
51 seconds to 23 minutes and 23 seconds, this scene reveals Martin's locked away
passion for teaching and it demonstrates him at his happiest point where even the students
who previously complained about him are cheering him on. However, As the experiment
escalates and the men begin consuming an outrageous amount of alcohol the negative
consequences become unavoidable, through the tragic suicide ot Tommy. This contrast
reinforces that alcohol is not the true solution to existential dissatisfaction. Instead, it
exposes the underlying human desire to escape numbness and to feel alive, something
Martin had been craving for, for a long time. For Martin, the tragedy forces a deeper
understanding that he must confront grief, responsibility and loss without the safety of
intoxication. This is where his growth becomes more authentic, since he is no longer

relying on alcohol to control his emotions he is facing life directly as he should’ve been
all these years.
The final scene of the film (21 minutes and 10 seconds), crystallizes his transformation as
he is seen dancing at graduation celebration. Although, at first glance it seems to just be a
dance, the dance is jazz ballet, a part of Martin that he locked away and through this
scene symbolizes how he reclaimed this lost part of himself. As dancing was a huge part
of his earlier life, this expresses how he is reconnecting with his identity. Additionally, he
is seen rebuilding a relationship with Anika after all the reserved years they spent
together. The broader message of this film is about life and how living is complex. The
film does not present a simple lesson that alcohol is either good or bad but instead uses
alcohol as a metaphor for the human desire to loosen control and feel more intensely
alive. The final message suggests that modern life often encourages emotional restraints,
routine, and excessive self-monitoring which can lead to people feeling and becoming
numb. I believe the film argues that life requires emotional risk, vulnerability and
willingness to experience pleasure and pain. Martin's growth reflects the idea that living
fully means choosing to participate in life more fully rather than being “invisible” as
Anika stated. Another Round demonstrates that to live life you must take risks,
experience emotions, and connect within the world rather than succumbing to alcohol.",88,"
Hi Kseniya, 

This is a fantastic essay in terms of content. You did an excellent job describing Martin's depression and analyzing the jazz ballet scene. Just be careful about claiming he is ""no longer relying on alcohol"" at the end. Since he is drinking throughout the final celebration, the final message is likely more about balance or acceptance than total sobriety. 

However, it is way too long. You are well over the 400-word limit. Being able to edit your thoughts down to the essential arguments is a critical skill. For your next assignments, focus on analyzing the scenes rather than retelling them. 

Lastly, be careful with some typos and run-on sentences. I've left comments directly on your submission. 

Overall, good work. "
3,"I loved Around the World; I was very intrigued the entire movie about how these four
men believed that drinking alcohol every day was beneficial for them and made their lives
better. At first it seemed that this was the case for Martin. Martin right away at the
beginning of the film already showed how unhappy and unmotivated he was with his life at
home and his professional career. The students in his class showed very little respect for
Martin because martin didn't have any respect for himself. He even asked his wife, Anika, if
he was boring now compared to his younger self, at which point she didn't hesitate to say
that he isn't the same Martin she met all those years ago (video 1 at 6 minutes 56
seconds.). At the birthday dinner for one of his four friends/collogues, they even expressed
how they thought he was boring for not drinking at dinner (video 1 at 12 minutes 35
seconds), and told him that he lacks self-confidence and happiness in the classroom and
that is why his students misbehave (video 1 at 15 minutes 46 seconds). He confides in his
friends that he never sees many people and that he and his wife haven't been the same in
so long before. So after the discussion about Finn Skarderud and his claim that you need to
maintain a 0.05% BAC to be more relaxed, poised, musical, and opened, Martin couldnt
resist the temptation and immediately chugged a glass of wine at dinner to the point where
they stay out super late and have a great night (video 1 at 22 minutes 53 seconds). You
start to see that his confidence really does grow and he is more brave to be himself and
actually get the students involved, you immediately can see that the students are far more
interested in class when Martin actually cares and is interested in what he is teaching
(video 2 at 2 minutes 25 seconds). But not only did his confidence improve, it did at home
as well, he took his family on their canoe and camping trip that they used to go on years
ago and even had an intimate moment with his wife (video 3 at 1 minute 20 seconds).
However, the rush couldn't las forever, eventually everything came crashing down when all
four men couldn't go a day without depending on alcohol to get through the day and even
lost their friend Tommy (video 4 at 10 minutes 55 seconds). Through everything though, I
think martin started to realize that alcohol is making his life worse, he saw what it did to his
friend tommy and really took a step back and looked in the mirror. I also think that he
realized he didn't need to drink to be passionate about what he does for a living. The
students passing those exams really showed him that if he just put in some effort and
attention, his students would pass, and it goes to show that just having confidence in
yourself can make the world of a difference and how you see yourself, present yourself, but
also be there for others as well.",85,"Hi Kealani, 

You did a great job tracking Martin's journey from feeling ""boring"" to the joy of the canoe trip. 

However, you need improvement in the following areas: 

Length: It is too long. The required word range is between 300 and 400 words. Next time, focus on analyzing the scenes rather than retelling them. 
Content analysis: You argued that Martin learned he doesn't need alcohol, but he is clearly drinking in the final moments of the movie. Addressing this is key to understanding the film's complex message. 
Accuracy: You referred to the film as ""Around the World."" 
Typos/Grammar: Please proofread before submission. I left comments directly on your submission. "
