Action

The couple Eva and Rocco invite their friends to dinner in their Munich attic apartment. Even before the guests arrive, there is a dispute between therapist Eva and her teenage daughter Sophie, after Eva found condoms in their pocket and confronted them. Sophie, who is on her way to her boyfriend Mike and has an increasingly tense relationship with her controlled mother, sees herself patronized again by Eva. Father Rocco, who can mediate between the two, meanwhile, employs something completely different: While the hobby chef is approached with the preparation of the food, he receives revealing selfies of an acquaintance on his mobile phone. Eva, who has been quietly observing her husband for a long time, is suspicious, but does not know about it.

First, the couple arrives Carlotta and Leo. Leo, who has put his career as a construction draftsman in favor of his wife, who has been working in an advertising agency again since the birth of the twins, is struggling with his fate as a house husband and full-time father. Carlotta, on the other hand, feels pushed into the second row: The copywriter, who usually works late into the evening and is rarely at home, has a distanced relationship with her children. The two will be accompanied by Bianca and Simon. Unlike Carlotta and Leo, the animal health practitioner and the life artist are freshly in love and strive for a trusting relationship with each other. However, Bianca, the youngest in the league, has only recently met Simon's longtime friends and occasionally feels ridiculed by the others.

After the high school teacher Pepe has arrived without his also expected and supposedly sick friend Anna and has placed his brought telescope to the sighting of the lunar eclipse announced for the night on the balcony, the group takes a seat in the dining room. At Rocco's inedible food and abundant wine, they begin to discuss the issue of honesty exuberantly. Without further ado, they want to put their mutual trust to the test and engage in a game conceived by Eva: Everyone must share all activities that run via their smartphone with those present. While Carlotta and Bianca immediately show themselves enthusiastic about the idea, the men only hesitantly agree with the project.

What should initially become a harmless game among friends quickly causes a glare: Leo, who has an affair with a playground acquaintance, expects a revealing photo of this and asks Pepe to exchange the mobile phones with him to cover up the matter. However, when Leo has to go to Pepe's phone in return, Pepe's contact reports to Hannes, whose ambiguities suggest to the others that he is sleeping with Leo. While Leo's supposed bisexuality, which he does not deny for fear of becoming aware of his actual affair with his friends, encounters incomprehension, Carlotta falls out of all the clouds and gets drunk. When she receives a clear voicemail from her colleague, she is forced to admit a drug problem triggered by the career pressure in her friends.

Pepe dissolves the farce when he confesses to the exchange action and reveals to the others his homosexuality, which has been concealed for many years, for which he is discriminated against by a father at his school and had expected incomprehension from his friends. Simon, meanwhile, receives a call from his colleague, who tells him to be pregnant by him. Bianca is deeply struck by the news and breaks with him immediately. Eva, who is secretly also having an affair with Simon, slaps him in the absence of the others and does the same. The guests then leave the apartment separately. Eva and Rocco, who are left alone, are looking for the conversation on the balcony and reconciling each other - but without telling the other about their own affair.

Some time after dinner, Leo and Carlotta have also found each other again and also opted for a role exchange: While he is pursuing a job offer, Carlotta now takes care of the two children full-time. In order to prove their friendship to the insulted Pepe, Rocco, Leo and Simon, meanwhile, beat up the father of Pepe's student, who then steers in and settles the conflict he provokes. The four childhood friends reconcile and travel together. When a ringing sounds along the way, Rocco draws an old-fashioned two-phone and confirms the other his affair. While Pepe, Leo and Simon try to snatch the device from him, Rocco throws the mobile phone into the Isar. ","I found the movie The Perfect Secret very interesting, which made me want to watch more. I even watched it more than once because I began to notice small details that indicated there were secrets between all of the friends from the very beginning. For example, the earrings Simon gave to Eva, or the photos Rocco received at the beginning, may have been related to his profession as a plastic surgeon. However, this is never fully explained, even though he is shown with a second cellphone at the end of the movie.

I find this topic and theme universal because cellphones are such an important part of our daily lives. Eva, who is a psychologist, mentions this idea at 17 minutes and 20 seconds into the movie, explaining that our phones contain GPS data, search history, blogs, messages, photos, location information, and personal details. This is when she states that everyone has something to hide and proposes a game called “Coming Clean.”

I found this relatable because most relationships are built on trust, but nobody is perfect, and some people do have things they keep hidden. Many relationships end because a partner searches the other’s phone and finds something unsettling. I also found this personally relatable because my wife and I have access to each other’s phones and have searched through them in the past. However, after many years, we grew to trust one another and slowly stopped doing that. We now have no problem with the other person using our phone, and have nothing to hide.

Overall, this movie sheds light on how people behave in the world today and how dependent we are on technology, especially our cellphones. It shows what could happen if someone took our phone and decided to go through it. Whether it is a friend, partner, or a stranger, the information on our devi",100.0,"

was not interested in the movie and had to take a break for two days. I didn't really give it a
chance, but the second time around, I decided to take notes and really try and focus on the
characters, and wow, did I make a mistake the first time! I fell in love with Bianca; from the
moment she talked to Pepe out on the patio about how to know if you are in love. She had
such an open mind and was such a sweetheart. She was definitely too good for Simon in
my opinion. I thought it was very interesting how Eva wanted to play this game, I knew from
the start it was just to see if her husband had been cheating on her, but I don't think she
realized how big of a mess she would create. From Carlotta’s phone call with her friend
Mouse talking about her and Leo’s nonexistent sex life (Video 1 at 43 minutes and 05
seconds till Video 2 at 2 minutes and 29 seconds), all the way to Leo and Pepe switching
phones so Leo wouldn't get caught with his “companion”, as he calls her (Video 1 at 40
minutes and 11 seconds) , and Pepe having to announce to all his friends that he was gay.
(Video 3 in 2 minutes, 55 seconds). I think why almost every culture can relate to this movie
is because everyone has secrets that hide from friends, family, and loved ones. Pepe was
hiding a huge part of himself from his friends because of the fear that they wouldn't accept
him or even like him anymore, and for a moment he was right in feeling that way. All three
of his friends, Rocco, Leo, and Simon, used hurtful language, and really made Pepe feel
uncomfortable with whom he is as a gay person (Video 2 at 34 minutes and 18 seconds). I
am glad that, at the end, the three boys made it up to Pepe by beating up the man who has
been sending hateful messages to him and became friends again. I think in every culture
we need to be honest and communicate with our friends and loved ones to avoid chaos
and drama, and to support them and love them for who they are.",95.0,"
Hi Kealani, 

I appreciate that you took the time to watch the film twice and engage deeply with the characters the second time around. 

You mentioned that ""all three"" friends were hurtful to Pepe, but this misses the nuance of the scene: Simon was the aggressor with homophobic comments, while Rocco was actually quite supportive and tried to de-escalate the situation.

Finally, try to maintain a more formal academic tone in future assignments and double-check your grammar (see the attached suggestions). 

Overall, good work! ",High,q3_75th

While Pepe, Leo and Simon try to snatch the device from him, Rocco throws the mobile phone into the Isar. ","This film covers a range of topics and themes such as homophobia, infidelity, and
the nature of friendship, and due to these topics it is adapted in more than 18 languages
across different cultures. The film shows how a group of friends sit at a dinner table and
explore their hidden secret. It shows how little the friends and romantic partners know
each other and how all their secrets are hidden in their phones. The film is able to be
adapted into multiple cultures because of its simplicity. The film was able to cover a
series of topics simply in the setting of friends at a dinner table playing a game. At the
core of the story is the idea that our smartphones hold our most private thoughts,
conversations, and secrets. Since smartphones are now an essential part of daily life
across the world, the fear of having one's digital life exposed is something audiences
from many cultural backgrounds can immediately relate to.
The topic also resonates universally because infidelity, trust, and secrecy are
fundamental issues in both romantic relationships and friendships. While different
cultures may have different cultural norms regarding privacy or relationships, nearly all
people understand the tension between wanting to be fully known and wanting to
protect a certain part of themselves. The dinner-table setting reinforces this universality
as sharing a meal with close friends, showing how intimate and realistic the situation is,
allowing the story to be easily adapted to different cultural contexts without losing its
impact.
There are multiple scenes that can be true for all relationships. For instance, at 42
minutes and 17 seconds, Carlotta gets a call from her childhood where she begins to
give advice on how to improve Carlotta's sex life with Leo. As a woman, this is relatively
relatable as I tell my girlfriends everything. In almost every friendship I've had with
another woman it is normal to open up about everything including more private things.
So, I believe this scene wonderfully demonstrates female friendships. Even after
Carlotta ends the conversation with her friend she doesn’t really show shame but rather
says “yes, surprise I talk to my best friend about our sex life” demonstrating the lack of
judgment and the deep trust that can exist in close friendships. This moment also shows
how different female relationships are in comparison to male friendships considering
Leo was very shocked by how comfortable she was to talk to her best friend about
private matters.
Another scene is at 29 minutes and 10 seconds of the second clip. Leo and Pepe
switched phones so Carlotta wouldn’t find out about Leo’s affair. However that soon
backfires because Pepe was hiding a secret about being homosexual. The scene erupts
into a huge misunderstanding where Carlotta believes her husband, Leo is gay.
However despite Pepe and Leo both knowing the truth of the situation, Leo refuses to
expose Pepe. This shows how deep the trust goes within their friendship. Leo’s
marriage was on the verge of collapsing but he refused to admit the truth only to defend
and protect his close friend. I believe it's fair to say that this scene can be shown across
all friendships, because in all friendships trust runs deep and it demonstrates how
friends have each other's backs no matter the situation.
Overall, the film “Perfect Secret” shows that simple settings can explore universal truths
about relationships. Through the dinner-table game and the revelations in scenes with
Carlotta and Leo, the film highlights trust, secrecy, and loyalty in both friendships and
romantic partnerships. These experiences are relatable across cultures, which is why
the story has been adapted into so many languages. The film demonstrates that,
despite cultural differences, the complexities of human relationships are truly universal.",86.0,"
Hi Kseniya, great job analyzing the film's gender dynamics. Your point about Carlotta was excellent: the universality here is that female friendships often involve a level of disclosure that men find shocking. 

However, you need to be much more concise. You exceeded the maximum word count by a wide margin. You have two introductory paragraphs that say essentially the same thing. You could combine these into one. 

Additionally, please proofread for phrasing and punctuation. In terms of phrasing, for example, you wrote ""Carlotta gets a call from her childhood...."" You likely meant ""from her childhood friend."" For punctuation, watch your commas. ""However that soon backfires..."" needs a comma after ""However."" ",High,median_high

While Pepe, Leo and Simon try to snatch the device from him, Rocco throws the mobile phone into the Isar. ","The German movie The Perfect Secret shows a theme that seems to work in almost any culture, how honesty, trust, and privacy affect relationships. The movies main idea is that a group of friends decides to share all the messages on their phones during a dinner. This situation creates a lot of tension, surprises, and funny moments. I think this story can be told in so many different countries because almost everyone has a phone and uses it to talk to friends, family, or romantic partners. Everyone also has secrets or things they keep private, so the story feels familiar no matter where you live.

One scene that really shows this is around 12 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, when the game starts and Bianca realizes how much personal information everyone can see. The friends all react with awkward laughter, shock, and a little panic. This scene shows how hard it is to balance honesty and privacy in relationships. It’s something everyone can relate to because we all have moments when we don’t want others to know everything about us, even our closest friends or partners. Another part that feels universal is when Pepe helps his student talk to a girl on social media. It shows that people often try to help each other but might do it in ways that reveal secrets or private things. These moments are both funny and real because they show how complicated relationships can be, even with good intentions.

Overall, I think The Perfect Secret works in so many cultures because it talks about things that are true for everyone trust, curiosity, and dealing with secrets. The story uses a smartphone, which everyone knows, but it’s really about how people interact, what they hide, and how they deal with each other. That’s why the movie has been adapted into so many languages and still makes sense everywhere.",84.0,"Hi Ciara,

You correctly identified the film's central themes of trust and privacy.

However, you claimed that the game starts around 12:30, but at that point in the film, the characters are simply having a conversation about Pepe's new partner; the game has not begun.

Additionally, phrases like ""awkward laughter, shock, and a little panic"" and ""funny moments"" are a bit general. To improve, you need to analyze why the character behaves as they do. Lastly, be careful with punctuation errors and possessive apostrophes.

Please cite a scene and situation in the film that you think is particularly true-for-all relationships, either romantic relationships or friendships. Indicate, using a time stamp, where in the film this comes up (e.g., Video 2 at 12 min 30 seconds).","The perfect secret is a 2019 German film comedy by director and screenwriter Bora Dagtekin.

The ensemble film is a remake of the Italian cinema film Perfetti Sconosciuti (about ""completely unknown"") by Paolo Genovese from 2016, which has already been remade in numerous countries. It is about seven friends who, at a dinner together, put their trust to the test by agreeing to share all the messages and calls received on their mobile phones during the meal with those present.

KammerspielThe tragicomic chamber play was produced by Constantin Film Production. In addition to Lena Schömann, Dagtekin also appeared as a producer. The filming took place between January and March 2019 in Munich and Geretsried. Karoline Herfurth, Elyas M'Barek, Florian David Fitz, Jella Haase, Frederick Lau, Jessica Schwarz and Wotan Wilke Möhring were committed to the cast. The German-wide release in the cinema took place on 31. October 2019. Among critics, the perfect secret came across a mixed echo.
Action

The couple Eva and Rocco invite their friends to dinner in their Munich attic apartment. Even before the guests arrive, there is a dispute between therapist Eva and her teenage daughter Sophie, after Eva found condoms in their pocket and confronted them. Sophie, who is on her way to her boyfriend Mike and has an increasingly tense relationship with her controlled mother, sees herself patronized again by Eva. Father Rocco, who can mediate between the two, meanwhile, employs something completely different: While the hobby chef is approached with the preparation of the food, he receives revealing selfies of an acquaintance on his mobile phone. Eva, who has been quietly observing her husband for a long time, is suspicious, but does not know about it.

First, the couple arrives Carlotta and Leo. Leo, who has put his career as a construction draftsman in favor of his wife, who has been working in an advertising agency again since the birth of the twins, is struggling with his fate as a house husband and full-time father. Carlotta, on the other hand, feels pushed into the second row: The copywriter, who usually works late into the evening and is rarely at home, has a distanced relationship with her children. The two will be accompanied by Bianca and Simon. Unlike Carlotta and Leo, the animal health practitioner and the life artist are freshly in love and strive for a trusting relationship with each other. However, Bianca, the youngest in the league, has only recently met Simon's longtime friends and occasionally feels ridiculed by the others.

After the high school teacher Pepe has arrived without his also expected and supposedly sick friend Anna and has placed his brought telescope to the sighting of the lunar eclipse announced for the night on the balcony, the group takes a seat in the dining room. At Rocco's inedible food and abundant wine, they begin to discuss the issue of honesty exuberantly. Without further ado, they want to put their mutual trust to the test and engage in a game conceived by Eva: Everyone must share all activities that run via their smartphone with those present. While Carlotta and Bianca immediately show themselves enthusiastic about the idea, the men only hesitantly agree with the project.

What should initially become a harmless game among friends quickly causes a glare: Leo, who has an affair with a playground acquaintance, expects a revealing photo of this and asks Pepe to exchange the mobile phones with him to cover up the matter. However, when Leo has to go to Pepe's phone in return, Pepe's contact reports to Hannes, whose ambiguities suggest to the others that he is sleeping with Leo. While Leo's supposed bisexuality, which he does not deny for fear of becoming aware of his actual affair with his friends, encounters incomprehension, Carlotta falls out of all the clouds and gets drunk. When she receives a clear voicemail from her colleague, she is forced to admit a drug problem triggered by the career pressure in her friends.

Pepe dissolves the farce when he confesses to the exchange action and reveals to the others his homosexuality, which has been concealed for many years, for which he is discriminated against by a father at his school and had expected incomprehension from his friends. Simon, meanwhile, receives a call from his colleague, who tells him to be pregnant by him. Bianca is deeply struck by the news and breaks with him immediately. Eva, who is secretly also having an affair with Simon, slaps him in the absence of the others and does the same. The guests then leave the apartment separately. Eva and Rocco, who are left alone, are looking for the conversation on the balcony and reconciling each other - but without telling the other about their own affair.

Some time after dinner, Leo and Carlotta have also found each other again and also opted for a role exchange: While he is pursuing a job offer, Carlotta now takes care of the two children full-time. In order to prove their friendship to the insulted Pepe, Rocco, Leo and Simon, meanwhile, beat up the father of Pepe's student, who then steers in and settles the conflict he provokes. The four childhood friends reconcile and travel together. When a ringing sounds along the way, Rocco draws an old-fashioned two-phone and confirms the other his affair. While Pepe, Leo and Simon try to snatch the device from him, Rocco throws the mobile phone into the Isar. ","I believe that the movie is trying to convey that everyone has issues with communication and secrecy in relationships. This theme has universal applicability because it reflects the truth that people aren’t completely honest in relationships. We might do it because we want to preserve the relationship and are worried that the truth might harm it.

This idea is particularly evident in how Pepe comes out in Video 3 starting at 3 minutes and 0 seconds. Pepe first calls out the casual homophobia that his friends do. This highlights one element of why Pepe did not come out to them. He felt that his friends might not accept him and that the Peretti Gang might disband, which is a group that represents a reprieve from the harassment from his workplace.

Only at the end, when other people shared their secrets, did he share his. This highlights how once communication becomes more common does other people feel more confident in sharing. Even if the communication was forced like it was in the phone game at the dinner.",70.0,"

What, do you think, is the insight Martin gains that allows him to grow? What might be the final message of the movie as to one's attitude toward life and living? ","Another Round (Danish: Druk, lit. 'Binge drinking') is a 2020 black comedy-drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg, co-written with Tobias Lindholm. Starring Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, and Lars Ranthe, the film follows four high school teachers who experiment with maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood to boost creativity and confidence.[1]

Premiering at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival, the film won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film and multiple other accolades. The film is dedicated to Vinterberg's daughter, Ida, who died during production.
Plot

Teachers Martin, Tommy, Peter, and Nikolaj are colleagues and friends who work at a gymnasium school in Copenhagen. All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. Martin is confronted by his senior students and their parents, who express that he has become a barrier to their passing their history exams. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group discusses a theory inspired by the work of psychiatrist Finn Skårderud-that humans are born with a blood alcohol content (BAC) deficiency of 0.05% and that maintaining a BAC of 0.05% makes one more creative and relaxed.

The friends decide to embark on an experiment to test Skårderud's theory. They start a group log documenting their experiences as they drink at regular intervals to maintain this blood alcohol level. Two of them have personal struggles that make the experiment particularly appealing: Martin is depressed and alienated from his family and students, while Nikolaj's wife seems to have contempt for him. They agree on a set of rules: their BAC should never drop below 0.05 during the day on weekdays, and they should not drink after 8:00 p.m. or on weekends. Each man finds his own way to sneak alcohol during the day while teaching or coaching children, but they never drink and drive, with 0.05 being the legal limit.

Within a short period, all four find their work and private lives more enjoyable and successful. Martin, in particular, is delighted as he reconnects with his wife and children. His teaching becomes inspired, and his students begin enjoying class and respecting him. He even incorporates alcohol into his history lessons, engaging his heavy-drinking students. Encouraged by their success, the group decides to take the experiment further, increasing their BAC minimum to 0.10. Still feeling the benefits, they eventually push the boundaries further, deciding one night to drink to oblivion to test its liberating effects. However, after returning home incapacitated, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family expresses concern, revealing that they have known he has been drinking for weeks. He and his wife acknowledge their growing distance, and she admits to infidelity. The group abandons the experiment. Martin and his wife separate, and although he tries to make amends, she rejects him.

All members of the group stop drinking during the day, except for Tommy, whom the others try to support. However, at a faculty meeting where the headmaster reveals that teachers have been drinking at work, Tommy arrives visibly intoxicated. Later, he boards his boat while drunk, takes his old dog with him, motors out onto the bay, and ultimately goes overboard, drowning at sea.

After Tommy's funeral, the three remaining friends go out to dinner to celebrate his life, enjoying sparkling wine. While dining, Martin receives a text from his wife saying she misses him. As they sit by the harbour, recently graduated students pass by, celebrating in their customary drunken revelry. Martin, Peter, and Nikolaj join them in drinking and dancing. Martin, a former jazz ballet dancer, finally gives in to his colleagues' previous urgings and dances with the students. His movements grow increasingly energetic and joyous before he finishes his dance by spontaneously jumping into the sea. Four teacher friends start a social experiment in Thomas Vinterberg's smart and ultimately moving ""Another Round."" Based on a belief that the human body is born with too low an alcohol level, they strive to maintain a 0.05% BAC at all times-buzzed but far from drunk. They set rules. They can only drink during work hours (yes, as teachers). The idea is that a low-level buzz releases stress and tension in ways that nothing else can. To varying degrees, all four men are going through what could be called a midlife crisis, dissatisfied by the mundanity of daily life as teachers, but it's Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is in the deepest funk. He has lost all passion for teaching his history class, feels distant from his family, and can't find many reasons to get up. The social experiment breaks him out of his rut in a relatively predictable way, but Mikkelsen elevates what could have been another traditional message movie about living life to the fullest even after you think you've had your final drink.

Shortly after the experiment begins, Vinterberg stages a scene in Martin's classroom, where he's engaging with his students in a way he clearly hasn't in years. He's getting them involved with vibrant conversation and new ways to look at history. He's smiling in that very Mads way. What's brilliant about the scene is how Vinterberg and cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen replicate that slightly wobbly feeling that comes after just a strong drink or two. Martin is nowhere near blacking out or doing anything embarrassing, but the slightly unsteady camera swoops in for a close-up and then back out again in the inconsistent way that the world sometimes does after a couple glasses of wine-the filmmaking coming to life like how Martin is with his new buzz on life. It's indicative of the high craft on display here as the visual language subtly matches the character's journey.

Martin's colleagues (Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, & Lars Ranthe-all effective) find similar success, at least at first. A music teacher encourages his students to sing more with their hearts and souls; a philosophy teacher catches onto the anxiety of one of his students in a way he may not have given his previously detached approach. Then the quartet starts to change the terms of the experiment, which everyone knows is a bad idea. If 0.05% works so well for Martin that he feels better even when he's sober, maybe he should go higher? They start pushing the envelope. Absinthe gets involved. As anyone who has tried it can tell you, Absinthe is almost always a bad idea. Trust me.  

""Another Round"" reaches beyond its set-up when it becomes a study in individuality. The experiment affects each of the four men differently, and everyone knows that a drunk night comes with a hungover morning. A student near the end gives an exam on the Kierkegaardian philosophies on anxiety and accepting fallibility and failure, which is what all midlife crisis films are about to a certain degree-coming to terms with mistakes after you realize you may be running out of time to correct them.  

The midsection of ""Another Round,"" wherein the guys open up and alter their experiment based on results, has a tendency to drag, but Vinterberg avoids cliché in this bulk of the film, thanks largely to casting his favorite leading man (Mikkelsen starred in the director's excellent ""The Hunt""). The ""Hannibal"" star is such a genuinely captivating actor-one of those performers who holds the camera like a movie star while also feeling completely realistic and in the moment at the same time. He doesn't hit a single false note in a film that really could have been all broad humor and wacky hijinks. Even as the final act starts to get a bit manipulative by stretching some previously established realism, Mikkelsen holds it together, and then he comes out literally swinging in one of the best final scenes of the year. It's such a jubilant moment that you may walk out of the theater feeling a little buzzed. ","At first glance, Another Round is a fascinating film. You begin watching it, thinking, ""Is there anything positive I will learn from this film?"" But as the film goes on, it becomes clear that the central message of the film, being in a constant but controlled stupor will benefit your life, is not sustainable. This message is conveyed mainly through Martin's transformation, which begins as personal and emotional stagnation and culminates in a completely new outlook on life.  

Early in the film, Martin seemed depressed but also detached from his career and family. Around 5:00 minutes, he struggles to lead his class through a lesson on Winston Churchill and appears mentally dissociated from both the material and his students. In fact, his lack of focus becomes so apparent that students begin correcting him on the lesson's historical details, most notably Malthe. This emotional detachment continues at home, where, at approximately 5:55, the film cuts to a solemn Martin. Although he is physically present at the table, you can tell Martin has completely given up on life. He barely engages in conversation with his wife or kids and appears emotionally distant. This scene establishes that Martin's depression is affecting all areas of his life.

A strong contrast happens later in the movie during the early stages of the alcohol experiment. Before entering his classroom, Martin tests his BAC (blood alcohol content) and reveals he is at a .047. Reflecting on what his group discussed, he is eager to see the effects. The camera then opens up to the classroom at around 1:03 in the second video, with Martin's demeanor toward his students changed. In the scene, Martin is much more relaxed, engaging with his students, and confident! He explains the lesson using an effective election metaphor, which gets many more students involved in the material.

The insight that allows Martin to grow is the realization that alcohol was never the true source of his confidence or his happiness. While the drinking lowered his anxiety and allowed him to reconnect to teaching, it created a nasty product in the end. The experiment revealed that all the qualities Martin thought he had lost were still inside him this whole time. By the end of the film, Martin realizes that real growth happens when you're actively engaged in life rather than escaping from it.",100.0,"Hi Daniel, 

This is a fantastic essay. You did a great job identifying Martin's initial state not just as ""sad,"" but as ""mentally disassociated"" and ""detached."" Also, your conclusion is a perfect summary of the film's existential theme. 

Excellent work. ",High,maximum

Even though keeping a BAC of 0.05% was supposed to make everyone feel more relaxed in the
experiment, it soon became something that grew out of control, leading to many damaged
relationships, and ruined reputations. In the film, Martin seems depressed and sad, trying to
reconstruct his marriage (Another Round, video 4, 1:27). He realized the outcomes of
participating in the experiment, and the effects of going overboard with drinking. In this scene,
he is telling his ex wife he misses her and is trying to apologize for his behavior. He seems to be
holding a lot of regret in his actions, stating that he wishes he was back together with his wife.
Shortly after, Anika leaves the table saying she can no longer love him or be with him. On the
other hand, Martin seems happy in the scene where he is canoeing with his family (Another
Round, video 3, 1:02). They are trying to race down to the land in front of them, laughter is
shared, and Martin seems truly happy around his family for the first time in the movie. After this
clip the film displays “0.0%” showing that he did not have any drinks before this activity. I believe
this shows the true meaning of the film. While Martin's drinking was the reason this trip was
even planned, he is truly happy to spend time with his family doing an activity they used to do
together many years ago. However, after this he gets very drunk with his friends doing the
experiment, and this ends up very poorly. As a result, he has to explain his actions to his kids
and wife. Anika brings up her concerns on how she has felt invisible to Martin for years. This
shows that Martin gained the insight of being able to have fun with his family without alcohol. It
also shows him the damage drinking can do to his relationships. The final message of this film is
that temporary placeholders, such as drugs or drinking, will never solve problems but make
them much worse. This is why there was a temporary relief for Martin when he started drinking
and teaching right after, but the overall result ended up with him losing his wife and being a bad
example for his children.",95.0,"
Hi Diana, 

You selected two strong scenes to contrast Marin's emotional state. 

While you have a good understanding of specific scenes, the essay reads a bit confusingly due to its organization. Currently, you present the restaurant scene (Video 4, 1:27), which occurs after the canoeing trip and the incident where Martin passes out on the street, before introducing the canoeing trip itself (Video 3). The essay would flow much more smoothly if you explained these scenes in the order they appear in the film, especially when you make the connection between these scenes. 

Additionally, for your next assignment, please pay attention to your use of punctuation (e.g., commas) and ensure you use the appropriate verb forms.

After Tommy's funeral, the three remaining friends go out to dinner to celebrate his life, enjoying sparkling wine. While dining, Martin receives a text from his wife saying she misses him. As they sit by the harbour, recently graduated students pass by, celebrating in their customary drunken revelry. Martin, Peter, and Nikolaj join them in drinking and dancing. Martin, a former jazz ballet dancer, finally gives in to his colleagues' previous urgings and dances with the students. His movements grow increasingly energetic and joyous before he finishes his dance by spontaneously jumping into the sea. Four teacher friends start a social experiment in Thomas Vinterberg's smart and ultimately moving ""Another Round."" Based on a belief that the human body is born with too low an alcohol level, they strive to maintain a 0.05% BAC at all times-buzzed but far from drunk. They set rules. They can only drink during work hours (yes, as teachers). The idea is that a low-level buzz releases stress and tension in ways that nothing else can. To varying degrees, all four men are going through what could be called a midlife crisis, dissatisfied by the mundanity of daily life as teachers, but it's Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is in the deepest funk. He has lost all passion for teaching his history class, feels distant from his family, and can't find many reasons to get up. The social experiment breaks him out of his rut in a relatively predictable way, but Mikkelsen elevates what could have been another traditional message movie about living life to the fullest even after you think you've had your final drink.

Shortly after the experiment begins, Vinterberg stages a scene in Martin's classroom, where he's engaging with his students in a way he clearly hasn't in years. He's getting them involved with vibrant conversation and new ways to look at history. He's smiling in that very Mads way. What's brilliant about the scene is how Vinterberg and cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen replicate that slightly wobbly feeling that comes after just a strong drink or two. Martin is nowhere near blacking out or doing anything embarrassing, but the slightly unsteady camera swoops in for a close-up and then back out again in the inconsistent way that the world sometimes does after a couple glasses of wine-the filmmaking coming to life like how Martin is with his new buzz on life. It's indicative of the high craft on display here as the visual language subtly matches the character's journey.

Martin's colleagues (Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, & Lars Ranthe-all effective) find similar success, at least at first. A music teacher encourages his students to sing more with their hearts and souls; a philosophy teacher catches onto the anxiety of one of his students in a way he may not have given his previously detached approach. Then the quartet starts to change the terms of the experiment, which everyone knows is a bad idea. If 0.05% works so well for Martin that he feels better even when he's sober, maybe he should go higher? They start pushing the envelope. Absinthe gets involved. As anyone who has tried it can tell you, Absinthe is almost always a bad idea. Trust me.  

""Another Round"" reaches beyond its set-up when it becomes a study in individuality. The experiment affects each of the four men differently, and everyone knows that a drunk night comes with a hungover morning. A student near the end gives an exam on the Kierkegaardian philosophies on anxiety and accepting fallibility and failure, which is what all midlife crisis films are about to a certain degree-coming to terms with mistakes after you realize you may be running out of time to correct them.  

The midsection of ""Another Round,"" wherein the guys open up and alter their experiment based on results, has a tendency to drag, but Vinterberg avoids cliché in this bulk of the film, thanks largely to casting his favorite leading man (Mikkelsen starred in the director's excellent ""The Hunt""). The ""Hannibal"" star is such a genuinely captivating actor-one of those performers who holds the camera like a movie star while also feeling completely realistic and in the moment at the same time. He doesn't hit a single false note in a film that really could have been all broad humor and wacky hijinks. Even as the final act starts to get a bit manipulative by stretching some previously established realism, Mikkelsen holds it together, and then he comes out literally swinging in one of the best final scenes of the year. It's such a jubilant moment that you may walk out of the theater feeling a little buzzed. ","I loved Around the World; I was very intrigued the entire movie about how these four
men believed that drinking alcohol every day was beneficial for them and made their lives
better. At first it seemed that this was the case for Martin. Martin right away at the
beginning of the film already showed how unhappy and unmotivated he was with his life at
home and his professional career. The students in his class showed very little respect for
Martin because martin didn't have any respect for himself. He even asked his wife, Anika, if
he was boring now compared to his younger self, at which point she didn't hesitate to say
that he isn't the same Martin she met all those years ago (video 1 at 6 minutes 56
seconds.). At the birthday dinner for one of his four friends/collogues, they even expressed
how they thought he was boring for not drinking at dinner (video 1 at 12 minutes 35
seconds), and told him that he lacks self-confidence and happiness in the classroom and
that is why his students misbehave (video 1 at 15 minutes 46 seconds). He confides in his
friends that he never sees many people and that he and his wife haven't been the same in
so long before. So after the discussion about Finn Skarderud and his claim that you need to
maintain a 0.05% BAC to be more relaxed, poised, musical, and opened, Martin couldnt
resist the temptation and immediately chugged a glass of wine at dinner to the point where
they stay out super late and have a great night (video 1 at 22 minutes 53 seconds). You
start to see that his confidence really does grow and he is more brave to be himself and
actually get the students involved, you immediately can see that the students are far more
interested in class when Martin actually cares and is interested in what he is teaching
(video 2 at 2 minutes 25 seconds). But not only did his confidence improve, it did at home
as well, he took his family on their canoe and camping trip that they used to go on years
ago and even had an intimate moment with his wife (video 3 at 1 minute 20 seconds).
However, the rush couldn't las forever, eventually everything came crashing down when all
four men couldn't go a day without depending on alcohol to get through the day and even
lost their friend Tommy (video 4 at 10 minutes 55 seconds). Through everything though, I
think martin started to realize that alcohol is making his life worse, he saw what it did to his
friend tommy and really took a step back and looked in the mirror. I also think that he
realized he didn't need to drink to be passionate about what he does for a living. The
students passing those exams really showed him that if he just put in some effort and
attention, his students would pass, and it goes to show that just having confidence in
yourself can make the world of a difference and how you see yourself, present yourself, but
also be there for others as well.",85.0,"Hi Kealani, 

You did a great job tracking Martin's journey from feeling ""boring"" to the joy of the canoe trip. 

However, you need improvement in the following areas: 

Length: It is too long. The required word range is between 300 and 400 words. Next time, focus on analyzing the scenes rather than retelling them. 
Content analysis: You argued that Martin learned he doesn't need alcohol, but he is clearly drinking in the final moments of the movie. Addressing this is key to understanding the film's complex message. 
Accuracy: You referred to the film as ""Around the World.""

M3_004,3,Another Round,"Although, at first glance, the film Another Round seems to endorse drinking alcohol to improve one's life, pretty quickly, we realize that getting tipsy is not improving the characters' lives in the long run. In fact, as can be seen in the suicide/death of one of the characters, drinking can also enhance negative and depressive feelings. However, although drinking was not the solution, and the film does not have a traditional Hollywood-like happy end, the main character, Martin, did undergo a transformation.

If the instructor suspects a student used an AI text generator (e.g., ChatGPT), the instructor will require student to complete a similar assignment using Honorlock, an online proctoring service. The instructor may also require a student to complete all remaining assignments in a proctored environment.
Please cite a scene in the film that shows him being depressed or unmotivated and a scene that showcases his changed, happier and more inspired, attitude. Indicate, using a time stamp, where in the film this comes up (e.g., Video 2 at 12 min 30 seconds).
What, do you think, is the insight Martin gains that allows him to grow? What might be the final message of the movie as to one's attitude toward life and living? ","Another Round (Danish: Druk, lit. 'Binge drinking') is a 2020 black comedy-drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg, co-written with Tobias Lindholm. Starring Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, and Lars Ranthe, the film follows four high school teachers who experiment with maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood to boost creativity and confidence.[1]

Premiering at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival, the film won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film and multiple other accolades. The film is dedicated to Vinterberg's daughter, Ida, who died during production.
Plot

Teachers Martin, Tommy, Peter, and Nikolaj are colleagues and friends who work at a gymnasium school in Copenhagen. All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. Martin is confronted by his senior students and their parents, who express that he has become a barrier to their passing their history exams. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group discusses a theory inspired by the work of psychiatrist Finn Skårderud-that humans are born with a blood alcohol content (BAC) deficiency of 0.05% and that maintaining a BAC of 0.05% makes one more creative and relaxed.

The friends decide to embark on an experiment to test Skårderud's theory. They start a group log documenting their experiences as they drink at regular intervals to maintain this blood alcohol level. Two of them have personal struggles that make the experiment particularly appealing: Martin is depressed and alienated from his family and students, while Nikolaj's wife seems to have contempt for him. They agree on a set of rules: their BAC should never drop below 0.05 during the day on weekdays, and they should not drink after 8:00 p.m. or on weekends. Each man finds his own way to sneak alcohol during the day while teaching or coaching children, but they never drink and drive, with 0.05 being the legal limit.

Within a short period, all four find their work and private lives more enjoyable and successful. Martin, in particular, is delighted as he reconnects with his wife and children. His teaching becomes inspired, and his students begin enjoying class and respecting him. He even incorporates alcohol into his history lessons, engaging his heavy-drinking students. Encouraged by their success, the group decides to take the experiment further, increasing their BAC minimum to 0.10. Still feeling the benefits, they eventually push the boundaries further, deciding one night to drink to oblivion to test its liberating effects. However, after returning home incapacitated, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family expresses concern, revealing that they have known he has been drinking for weeks. He and his wife acknowledge their growing distance, and she admits to infidelity. The group abandons the experiment. Martin and his wife separate, and although he tries to make amends, she rejects him.

All members of the group stop drinking during the day, except for Tommy, whom the others try to support. However, at a faculty meeting where the headmaster reveals that teachers have been drinking at work, Tommy arrives visibly intoxicated. Later, he boards his boat while drunk, takes his old dog with him, motors out onto the bay, and ultimately goes overboard, drowning at sea.

It's such a jubilant moment that you may walk out of the theater feeling a little buzzed. ","In the movie Another Round it may seem as if drinking alcohol helped the characters’ lives
improve, but as the movie goes on it clearly reflects that it did not help with their problems.
The film reflects how alcohol brings out deeper issues and negative emotions. Based on
Martins character, the movie shows how real change does not come from drinking, it
comes from how a person chooses to face life and address their personal struggles.
At the beginning of the movie Martin is a teacher and his character is shown as depressed
and unmotivated (Video 3, 10-15minutes). In this scene before the drinking experiments
even begin Martin appears to be disconnected, tired and unhappy in his personal and
professional life. The student in his classroom starts to question his teaching because he
struggles to keep them engaged and seems very unsure of himself.
As the movie goes on you can start to see a change in Martin attitude when teaching he
seemed more confident and inspired (Video 3, 20-45 min). In this scene he is more energic
and engages with his students more. He is happier and more present in the classroom than
before. This scene shows his temporary sense of motivation.
Another scene is the graduation at the end of the movie when Martin joins in dancing and
celebrating (Video 3, 1 hour and 45 minutes). This scene shows that Martin has reached a
place where he feels more alive and open to life again despite the experiment causing
serious consequences.
Through this experience, Martin realizes that alcohol was never the real solution. He gained
the understanding he needed to engage with life. The final message that the movie portrays
is that growth comes from choosing to participate in life even when life becomes difficult
or uncertain.",80.0,"Hi Rajdai, 

You identified a strong final message that growth comes from ""choosing to participate in life even when life becomes difficult."" This aligns perfectly with the film's themes. 

However, you referenced ""Video3"" for scenes that happen at the very beginning of the movie. Please ensure you are referencing the correct video files in your timestamps. Additionally, to deepen your analysis, consider adding your interpretation of Martin's emotional change rather than just describing the scenes. For example, how exactly did he get more confident and inspired? Was it purely the alcohol, or was there something else? 

Lastly, please double-check your writing before submission. I left comments on your submission. 

Overall, good job! ",Low,q1_25th
