3,"The film ”Another Round” has many twists in the outcomes of alcohol endorsement.
Even though keeping a BAC of 0.05% was supposed to make everyone feel more relaxed in the
experiment, it soon became something that grew out of control, leading to many damaged
relationships, and ruined reputations. In the film, Martin seems depressed and sad, trying to
reconstruct his marriage (Another Round, video 4, 1:27). He realized the outcomes of
participating in the experiment, and the effects of going overboard with drinking. In this scene,
he is telling his ex wife he misses her and is trying to apologize for his behavior. He seems to be
holding a lot of regret in his actions, stating that he wishes he was back together with his wife.
Shortly after, Anika leaves the table saying she can no longer love him or be with him. On the
other hand, Martin seems happy in the scene where he is canoeing with his family (Another
Round, video 3, 1:02). They are trying to race down to the land in front of them, laughter is
shared, and Martin seems truly happy around his family for the first time in the movie. After this
clip the film displays “0.0%” showing that he did not have any drinks before this activity. I believe
this shows the true meaning of the film. While Martin's drinking was the reason this trip was
even planned, he is truly happy to spend time with his family doing an activity they used to do
together many years ago. However, after this he gets very drunk with his friends doing the
experiment, and this ends up very poorly. As a result, he has to explain his actions to his kids
and wife. Anika brings up her concerns on how she has felt invisible to Martin for years. This
shows that Martin gained the insight of being able to have fun with his family without alcohol. It
also shows him the damage drinking can do to his relationships. The final message of this film is
that temporary placeholders, such as drugs or drinking, will never solve problems but make
them much worse. This is why there was a temporary relief for Martin when he started drinking
and teaching right after, but the overall result ended up with him losing his wife and being a bad
example for his children.",95,"
Hi Diana, 

You selected two strong scenes to contrast Marin's emotional state. 

While you have a good understanding of specific scenes, the essay reads a bit confusingly due to its organization. Currently, you present the restaurant scene (Video 4, 1:27), which occurs after the canoeing trip and the incident where Martin passes out on the street, before introducing the canoeing trip itself (Video 3). The essay would flow much more smoothly if you explained these scenes in the order they appear in the film, especially when you make the connection between these scenes. 

Additionally, for your next assignment, please pay attention to your use of punctuation (e.g., commas) and ensure you use the appropriate verb forms. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"In Another Round Martin's emotional state is clearly revealed during two closely connected scenes in the third video. Around 23:53, as Martin leaves his friend's house, he appears visibly defeated and emotionally exhausted. Reflecting the ongoing strain between him and his wife Anika. Their relationship is marked by poor communication, emotional distance and a sense of mutual disappoint, which weighed heavy on Martin. Although Martin's friend tells him that I am ""rooting for you, Martin. And Anika. You know?"" He further points points out Martin that it has always been him and his wife, ""Martin and Anika."" In that moment Martin does not respond with optimism, instead his defeated posture suggests that the marital troubles have left him feeling isolated, discouraged about the future of their relationship.

Shortly after, at approximately 29:22, the tone of moment shifts. As Martin is about to leave, his friend tells him. ""You can do anything."" After the door closes, Martin pauses and takes a moment to reflect on what was said. This brief hesitation is significant, as it signals a quiet emotional change. His expression softens, and it becomes clear that the reassurance has reached him. In this moment he realizes that he is not alone in his suffering. This allowed him to realize for the first time in film that he has someone genuinely in his corner who truly believes and supports him. This moment restores a small but important sense of hope. Knowing that someone believes in him and supports him and his marriage gives Martin emotional stability at his lowest moment. This scene highlights the importance of true friendship, the power of positive affirmation as well as human connection. Showing that no matter how down and out you maybe if you have someone in your corner to provide you with love and support that it can restore your faith yourself.",90,"Hi Larry, 

You focused on the theme of friendship, which is certainly present in the film. The bond between the teachers is indeed a support system for Martin. 

However, your essay misses the most critical component of Martin's transformation: the role of alcohol and the film's final message. While friendship helps him grow, the movie is fundamentally about how the drinking experiment impacts his life. To fully answer the prompt, you need to discuss the main events, specifically Tommy's funeral and Martin's dance at the harbor. These moments are essential for understanding his change in attitude. 

Additionally, please proofread for the following areas: 

punctuation (e.g., ""In Another Round, Martin's)
word form (e.g., ""...emotional distance, and a sense of mutual disappointment"") 
word choice (e.g., ""However, Martin's friend tells him..."")
redundancy (e.g., ""He further points points.."") 
preposition (e.g., ""...points out Martin that..."""
3,"In Another Round, Martin is introduced as a middle-aged teacher, who is observed to be
In Video 1 at 9 minutes 30 seconds, we see Martin interacting with his family. His
relationships to both his wife and children are strained and he behaves passively towards
them. As he walks into the room where his sons are, he holds his gaze towards them for a
moment, perhaps to convey that he also sees the same apathy and is concerned about the
behavior he is modeling for them. He passionlessly tells his friends at dinner that he would
not leave his wife because she is the mother of his children and she took care of his father
before he died. He said nothing of her qualities, personality, or even her physical
attributes, nothing about who she is as a person, nor anything that He may feel that he has
nothing to lose by participating in the drinking experiment, as he has not found a better way
to engage with his family or with his life up until now. Once the experiment begins, there is
a marked difference in Martin’s attitude and actions. In Video 2 at 23 minutes 42 seconds,
we see him
When the group decides to stop the experiment, they cite negative social consequences as
the reason. While they do experience positive effects, such as a higher energy baseline
while at work, they also find that these come at a cost. Martin, for instance, experiences
the embarrassment of waking up in front of a neighbor’s house, being found and guided
home by his young son and later having to provide an explanation for his behavior to both
his sons. The same pattern follows, where he looks at his children and seemingly reflects
on what example he is setting for them as they grow up. The others, too, experience
personal and professional consequences from how their behavior affects those around
them. It is for this reason, they decide that these negatives outweigh whatever benefits
being perpetually intoxicated offered them. The ending shows, though, that they are not
swearing off alcohol altogether, though. They concede that there are situations and
locations that are socially accepted as being appropriate for imbibing alcoholic drinks and
indulging in the high they offer, and there are others where it is not considered acceptable.
This could be seen as a direct challenge to the philosophies of Kierkegaard…
",95,"Hi Alexis, 

You selected two excellent opposing scenes to demonstrate Martin's transformation. 

You argue that Martin gives up intoxication to save his marriage, which is true for the climax. However, the movie ends with Martin drinking and dancing wildly at the harbor. Integrating that final dance into your conclusion would have made your analysis of the film's message much more accurate. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"In the film Another Round, Martin’s character goes through a clear change from being
unmotivated and unhappy to feeling more alive and engaged with life. At the beginning of the
movie, Martin is shown emotionally stuck, especially in his role as a teacher. One scene that
clearly shows this is during his history class that he teaches around Video 1 around 8:30. In this
scene, Martin lectures in a dull, monotone way, and his students are visibly bored and frustrated.
Some of them even complain that he is a bad teacher. Martin barely reacts, which shows how
disconnected he feels. His lack of energy and confidence suggests that he is not only burned out
at work but also struggling personally.
Later in the film, Martin’s attitude shifts significantly. A strong change appears in the final scene
during the graduation celebration, around Video 4 at about 19:20-20:50. Here, Martin joins in the
celebration and dances with joy and freedom. This moment feels completely different from his
earlier behavior. He looks relaxed, confident, and genuinely happy. His movements are
expressive and carefree, showing us that he has reconnected with his emotions and the people
around him. This scene represents Martin finally letting go of his emotional restraint and
allowing himself to live in the moment.
The main insight Martin gains is that he has been living too cautiously and emotionally closed
off. Through the experiment, he realizes that his unhappiness was not just about alcohol levels,
but about losing passion, connection, and purpose in his life. While alcohol initially helps him
open up, the film makes it clear that it is not a long-term solution. This is especially shown
through the negative consequences of pushing the experiment too far, particularly with Tommy’s
storyline and passing.
Overall, the final message of the movie seems to be about balance and engagement with life.
Another Round suggests that while responsibility is important, life also requires risk, presence,
and being emotionally open. Martin’s growth shows that truly living means being willing to feel,
connect, and participate fully in life instead of simply going through the motions.",98,"Hi Isaiah, 

This is an outstanding essay. You selected the perfect scenes to illustrate Martin's transformation. 

Your analysis of the film's message is particulalry strong, especially your conclusion that truly living requires ""risk, presence, and being emotionally open.""

You mentioned that Martin was living ""too cautiously."" While fear is definitely part of it, consider if ""indifference"" or ""apathy"" is an even more precise descriptor for his state at the beginning.

Additionally, please proofread for minor grammar/phrasing (see attached comments to your submission).

Overall, great job on this! "
3,"I think the insight that allowed Martin to grow was discovering that not all problems can go away just by using alcohol. He was using it as a escape and when he first started, it was improving his mentality and his way of teaching. The way he was using alcohol wasn't in a bad way for any bad reasons, he just wanted to be less boring. It almost makes you feel really bad for the character because of the way that his story is brought up. Eventually with too much, as too much of anything can be overwhelming, he started to abuse the alcohol usage, making him more depressed and unable to perform the day to day tasks. His words would be slurring together in class, he even went to see how drunk he could get with his friends to reach the maximum alcohol volume which started the spiral. As seen for example in Video 3 17:09, his own son had to help take him home when he became too drunk, laying in the road in front of the wrong house, which aided in starting the whole divorce and split custody battle from what it seemed in the scene with him and his (ex) wife in the restaurant. I think the final message of the movie is to never take life for granted because eventually bad habits can catch up to you. When his friend died he started changing his life and encouraging the good behaviors that he should have had in the beginning. I think his final discovery at the end was that he has the positive mindset that everything is going to be okay, things might look up which is why he was dancing and having a good time with his friends and students at the end (Video 4 21:26).",94,"Hi Kathryn, 

You selected a very powerful scene to illustrate Martin's rock bottom moment, which perfectly captures the negative spiral of the experiment. 

To improve your analysis, look closer at the ending: Martin isn't just ""encouraging good behaviors."" He is drinking again. Discussing this would have deepened your essay. 

Additionally, please pay attention to the following areas: 

article usage (e.g., ""He was using it as an escape.."")
punctuation (e.g., ""...using alcohol wasn't in a bad way for any bad reasons; he just wanted to..."") 
verb form (e.g., ""...when he became too drunk, lying in the road..."") 
Overall, good work! "
3,"At the start of the film, it was visible that Martin was unmotivated and depressed,
(Video 1, 6 minutes: 38 seconds). In this scene Martin asks his wife if “he is boring?”,
she answers that he isn’t the same man she met before. Martin asking this question
showed his vulnerability and self-doubt, which is later emphasized (Video 1, 10
minutes:14 seconds) when Martin tries to talk with his wife regarding his job issues
but once the kids interrupt them, he backs down without any discussion of the
problem. In contrast, later in the film when he drinks his attitude changes into a more
proactive one. He asks his wife to go canoeing during fall vacation, like they did 8
years ago, instead of staying inside the house (Video 2, 9 minutes: 20seconds). Later
in the film he follows through with this plan by booking the canoeing trip after
increasing his alcohol intake to 1.2 (Video 2, 23 minutes: 47 seconds).
I think that Martin gains the insight that he can live life without the influence of alcohol
and that it affected the relationships he cherished the most. I think this insight started
in Video 3, 29 minutes: 5 seconds, when Martin went to Tommy’s house and took care
of the dishes, food and the dog. Tommy said he was rooting for “You and Anika” and
that Martin should hold his head high like his old self. I believe this reminded Martin of
how he was in the past and that he could be happy and have a positive attitude even
without alcohol. Therefore, allowing him to encourage his students for exams without
drinking alcohol and still celebrating with them. Overall, the final message of the film
might be that people should cherish personal relationships without the influence of
addicting things like alcohol or drugs. However, the movie also shows that in
moderation and control alcohol can help people like how it helped the student with
his presentation and how the graduating class celebrated their test results.
Emphasizing a final message that people should have a positive attitude towards life
that contains balance between their personal relationships, goals and fun.
",97,"Hi Elena,

You selected excellent scenes to illustrate Martin's transformation. The contrast between his inability to talk to Anika and his proactive planning of the canoe trip effectively demonstrates how the alcohol initially ""woke him up.""

You concluded that the final message is about ""balance,"" which is a strong argument, but analyzing the visual scene (i.e., Martin's dance) would have deepened your analysis.

Finally, please pay attention to the small grammar details (see attached comments on your submission). "
3,"At first, Another Round makes it seem like drinking alcohol might help improve life.
However, it quickly becomes clear that alcohol is not a long-term solution. While drinking
makes the characters feel more confident and motivated at first, it eventually increases their
emotional struggles. This is most clearly shown through the death of one character, which
highlights how alcohol can deepen sadness and depression rather than fix it. Even though the
film does not end with a traditional happy ending, Martin still goes through an important
personal change.
Early in the film, Martin appears depressed and unmotivated. This is shown in the
classroom scene around 12–15 minutes, when students complain that he is boring and
disconnected. Martin looks tired, uninterested, and emotionally distant, showing that he has lost
passion for both teaching and life. Another moment that shows his unhappiness is his birthday
dinner (around 18 minutes), where he refuses to dance and avoids having fun, suggesting he has
closed himself off from joy.
By the end of the film, Martin’s attitude has changed. This is most clear in the final scene
at the graduation celebration (around 1 hour and 46 minutes). Martin joins the students and
dances freely. Unlike earlier moments, this happiness does not feel forced or controlled. Instead,
it shows someone who has let go of fear and is willing to fully participate in life.
The insight Martin gains is that alcohol is not what makes life meaningful. Drinking only
temporarily covered up his deeper problems. What he really needed was connection, purpose,
and the courage to take emotional risks. The final message of the film suggests that life cannot be
controlled or perfected, but it can be lived fully if one is willing to be present, open, and
engaged—even when the future is uncertain.
",96,"Hi Mirel, 

You structured this essay very well by focusing on the motif of dancing. Your conclusion is a sophisticated interpretation of the film's theme. 

However, your essay itself is slightly under the word count (298 words), and your descriptions are sometimes a bit general. For example, when you mention ""the death of one character,"" name him and explain specifically how the death impacted Martin's final decision to dance. 

Overall, great job! "
3,"Martin is depressed and unmotivated for Video 3, 22 minutes and 50 seconds. He is the most alive and joyful at Video 4, 21 minutes and 22 seconds. 

Martin's main insight is that genuine living does not come from artificial stimulation. but instead of embracing life's messiness with awareness and courage. In the beginning and middle, Martin is drowning in alcoholism and slowly drifts from his family and state of mind. He, at one point, looked to be reflecting on his negative emotions and actions as he sat in the kitchen with his friends; possibly a sign of self-evaluation and realization. Near the end of the film, Martin finds himself accepting rather than despairing his loss. In the end, he was joyful and captured his transformation symbolically. He is neither drunk nor sober, nor broke nor fully healed; he is simply alive and enjoying the present moment, embracing uncertainty.

The film's final message suggests that life can not be perfected or controlled through formulas, whether of sobriety or excess. Instead, the vitality we seek must come from within; a willingness to engage with both joy and sorrow, risk and restraint. The film ultimately encourages an attitude of balance. To approach life not as something to endure or escape from, but something to fully participate in, with gratitude and passion. Martin's growth is not about rejecting his experiment, but about reclaiming his capacity to feel, choose, and live deliberately, all while accepting that life is beautiful in its imperfections. The world can really take from this film as a way to just live in the scene and not allow hardships to control them. People should not drown themselves in more sorrow to escape from their reality, but rather make more of what they have and keep living for themselves and those they love, and love you as well.",95,"
Hi Golden, 

Your analysis of the film's philosophy is outstanding. Your description of Martin at the end (""neither drunk nor sober..."") perfectly captures the ambiguity of the ending. 

For your next assignments, try to describe the specific details of your selected scenes to prove why and/or how they show depression or joy. In your current essay, you listed timestamps but didn't explain them well enough. 

Additionally, be careful with punctuation (""from artificial stimulation, but instead"") and prepositions (""unmotivated in Video 3 at 22 minutes"").

Overall, great work! "
3,"Drinking is an extremely addictive habit that many fall into whether it's being
introduced to it at a young age, or going through a hard moment in your life where you
need to find a way to forget about everything and relax. In Another Round, at the
beginning of the film we see that Martin is going through a tough life. He isn’t having
much enjoyment teaching, he doesn’t have a passionate relationship with his life, and
overall he believes he has become boring. His depression is not presented as a result of
one single event, but rather as a slow erosion of meaning, confidence, and emotional
engagement. A scene that demonstrates his depression would be at the very beginning at
4 minutes and 55 seconds. This scene shows his lack of passion for his profession and
how disconnected he is with his students and job. Additionally, at 6 minutes and 35
seconds, he asks his wife if he has become bored, this question further unraveles the
depression he has been feeling inside.
The film then turns into an alcohol experiment amongst four teachers, Martin included.
While alcohol is framed as dangerous as shown at the beginning of the first clip up to 3
minutes and 30 seconds where the student had gotten so out of control the consumption
of alcohol had to be banned during that semester. It functions as a tool that lowers
Martin's defenses, meaning under the influence he becomes more expressive, a more
energetic and dynamic teacher, and finds the missing passion with his wife again. An
example of where Martin shows a transformation is in the second clip at 19 minutes and
51 seconds to 23 minutes and 23 seconds, this scene reveals Martin's locked away
passion for teaching and it demonstrates him at his happiest point where even the students
who previously complained about him are cheering him on. However, As the experiment
escalates and the men begin consuming an outrageous amount of alcohol the negative
consequences become unavoidable, through the tragic suicide ot Tommy. This contrast
reinforces that alcohol is not the true solution to existential dissatisfaction. Instead, it
exposes the underlying human desire to escape numbness and to feel alive, something
Martin had been craving for, for a long time. For Martin, the tragedy forces a deeper
understanding that he must confront grief, responsibility and loss without the safety of
intoxication. This is where his growth becomes more authentic, since he is no longer

relying on alcohol to control his emotions he is facing life directly as he should’ve been
all these years.
The final scene of the film (21 minutes and 10 seconds), crystallizes his transformation as
he is seen dancing at graduation celebration. Although, at first glance it seems to just be a
dance, the dance is jazz ballet, a part of Martin that he locked away and through this
scene symbolizes how he reclaimed this lost part of himself. As dancing was a huge part
of his earlier life, this expresses how he is reconnecting with his identity. Additionally, he
is seen rebuilding a relationship with Anika after all the reserved years they spent
together. The broader message of this film is about life and how living is complex. The
film does not present a simple lesson that alcohol is either good or bad but instead uses
alcohol as a metaphor for the human desire to loosen control and feel more intensely
alive. The final message suggests that modern life often encourages emotional restraints,
routine, and excessive self-monitoring which can lead to people feeling and becoming
numb. I believe the film argues that life requires emotional risk, vulnerability and
willingness to experience pleasure and pain. Martin's growth reflects the idea that living
fully means choosing to participate in life more fully rather than being “invisible” as
Anika stated. Another Round demonstrates that to live life you must take risks,
experience emotions, and connect within the world rather than succumbing to alcohol.",88,"Hi Kseniya, 

This is a fantastic essay in terms of content. You did an excellent job describing Martin's depression and analyzing the jazz ballet scene. Just be careful about claiming he is ""no longer relying on alcohol"" at the end. Since he is drinking throughout the final celebration, the final message is likely more about balance or acceptance than total sobriety. 

However, it is way too long. You are well over the 400-word limit. Being able to edit your thoughts down to the essential arguments is a critical skill. For your next assignments, focus on analyzing the scenes rather than retelling them. 

Lastly, be careful with some typos and run-on sentences. I've left comments directly on your submission. 

Overall, good work.

3,"Throughout the beginning of the film, we can clearly notice Martin is struggling to focus on everyday social interactions, his job, and even his own family. This is due to his addiction to drinking alcohol and I have observed that he seems to ""blank out"" in some scenes, as if he cannot concentrate or listen to what's in front of him.  He seems unmotivated or even sad throughout his everyday interactions. In the film around (Video 1 at 25 min 31 seconds) Martin almost looks ashamed that he has to drink in the bathroom during his job as a teacher to feel more productive, aware, and even friendlier. As soon as that scene is over, it cuts to him smiling down the school hallway and saying ""hello"" to everyone and just appearing happier all of a sudden.

A scene I felt Martin gained insight during (Video 3 at 27 min 40 seconds) and allowed himself to grow a little was seeing his family and marriage go downhill and he finally realized he was actively not focusing on what really mattered in his life. His wife did not want to rekindle their relationship back to what it was, and he seemed deeply saddened and almost ashamed because he knew he was all to blame.  Also, around (Video 4 at 11min and 57 seconds) at the funeral all the guys seem like they are having a sense of realization after their friend passes. Especially after the funeral when they go out to the restaurant and get a drink, they all almost seem to hesitate and look around before taking their first sip. But shortly after the funeral there is this big celebration, and they seem to almost forget it all happened and start drinking alcohol again to not face their realities and what they have become. ",88,"
Hi Aracely, 

You made a fantastic observation about the funeral scene, which shows that their relationship with alcohol has changed. 

However, it seems like you misunderstood some parts of the movie. You stated that Martin's struggle at the beginning is ""due to his addiction to drinking."" At the very beginning, Martin is not an alcoholic yet; he is sober, depressed, and ""boring."" The drinking experiment starts later as a way to cure that depression. He becomes dependent during the movie, but his initial unhappiness is not caused by alcohol. 

Also, you concluded that at the end, they ""forget it all happened"" and drink ""to not face their realities."" While valid, it misses a crucial detail: Anika's text message. Just before the dance, Martin receives a text from his wife saying she misses him. He isn't drinking to escape reality; he is celebrating the possibility of a new reality where he is forgiven. Additionally, he is performing a jazz ballet, a form of expression he abandoned years ago. Addressing this nuance would strengthen your essay. 

Lastly, be careful with run-on sentences. 

Overall, good work! "
3,"At the beginning of the film, one of the moments that really shows Martin's initial depressive state was his interaction with his wife Anika, especially when he asks her ""Am I boring?"" (Video 1, 6:11-7:00). This contrasts his demeanor when he goes on the camping and canoeing trip with his family, where he starts to show the positive effects of the study, even at a BAC of 0% while on the entirety of the trip (Video 3, 0:54-1:30). The insight that Martin gains both through his participation in the experiment and through the moments he has outside of such are about the idea of living life fully as he did previously.

At the dinner party before the experiment, Nikolaj, Tommy, and Peter bring up Martin's demeanor, especially when they first ask him questions about the school and his personal life, with Nikolaj saying ""I think you lack self-confidence. And joy."" (Video 1, 15:40-15:45). Going forward, the audience watches Martin's journey to becoming more self-confident and finding joy in all areas of his life again, eventually without the effects of the alcohol that were initially tried during the experiment. The final message the movie shows through Martin's journey is that there are times that someone needs to find themselves again, but through implementing positive changes, they can take a similar journey to Martin's and result in a more self-fulfilling place mentally. The difference between real life and this film though is more about the connection that Martin regains with his friends more than the effects of the experiment itself.

While he ends the film with a bittersweet relationship with his wife Anika, the connection he regains with his friends and with his students due to his changed outlook show through, especially at the graduation party for the students (Video 4, 18:50-22:35). The song that plays during this scene as well reinforces this idea of his changed mindset as he goes through the film, adding to the message of connection and regaining an open outlook on the things in life one already has.",92,"Hi Kalie, 

You made a strong start by contrasting the ""Am I boring"" scene with the canoe trip. That was a great use of specific evidence to show Martin's transformation. 

However, the second half of the essay feels a bit too general. You relied on broad phrases like ""positive changes"" and ""finding themselves"" rather than analyzing what actually happens on screen. 

For instance, you claimed Martin finds joy ""without alcohol"" at the end. If you look closely at the final scene again, you'll see Martin holding a bottle, drinking, and dancing wildly. It shows a specific and complex moment. 

Lastly, be careful with run-on sentences. 

Overall, great job! "
3,"Through Martin’s experience, the film suggests that true personal development comes from self-
reflection and active engagement, not from drinking. At first, it seems as though alcohol could
improve the lives of the characters by increasing their confidence, happiness, and sense of social
connection; but then, during the course of the film, one sees that such things are but a temporary
escape; deep problems remain and often become worse.
This moment shows that Martin was already unhappy and dissatisfied with his life before the
drinking experiment began, and it also shows from the relationship with his wife how thoroughly
alienated and inhibited he feels in daily life. At a parents' meeting, where he is criticized as a
teacher for being boring and emotionally cold, Martin is seen to look awkward and very quiet
(Video 1 at 9 minutes 11 seconds). His silence makes it clear that he had completely lost
confidence in his job and in himself. At the beginning of the film, Martin clearly struggles with
depression and a lack of motivation.It causes Martin to acknowledge how passive he has been, and how he has been avoiding dealing
directly with his problems. The death of one of their group of friends points out that alcohol may
intensify emotional distress rather than ease it, and as the experiment continues the adverse
consequences of alcohol become more and more serious; this event becomes a turning point for
Martin, forcing him to confront the consequences of avoiding his emotions instead of dealing
with them directly. When Martin takes up drinking with his comrades, he grows more energetic
and productive in the classroom; his lessons improve and his students respond better to him. But

the transformation does not last; the effects of alcohol become more and more serious, and in an
eventual and unexpected fashion the effect of this experiment is shown to all.
The film’s overall message suggests that life requires accepting uncertainty rather than trying to
escape it and learning how to live fully despite those feelings. Finally, as he dances with his
students at their seaside, he seems happier and more joyful than he has been on previous
occasions (Video 4 at 20 minutes 36 seconds), because he is less governed by alcohol. That may
be why the graduation scene is so memorable: he is joyous and responsive to life’s pleasures, in
great accord with their own excitement, and without using alcohol as a cover. This moment
shows that Martin is no longer searching for control through alcohol but instead chooses to be
present and emotionally open.
",96,"
Hi Pham,

You did a great job identifying the parents' meeting as a key scene to showcase Martin's initial lack of confidence. Your description of his silence there is very effective.

However, you claim Martin dances ""without using alcohol,"" but he is actually drinking beer and champagne throughout that sequence. Recognizing that he is happy while intoxicated is crucial to understanding the film's ambiguous ending.

Additionally, the structure of your essay feels a bit confusing. Paragraphs often begin with ""This moment"" or ""It"" without establishing context, which can be confusing for readers. I also left comments directly on your submission for run-on sentences. 

Overall, good work!"
3,"In the film ""Another round"", the movie starts off with an idea that alcohol is something positive. This then switches quickly however, and we see how alcohol leads to emotional and personal costs. In short term, we see how alcohol boosts a person's feeling, but then we see how in the long term, alcohol deepens struggles and has negative effects. Alcohol leads to depression and loneliness, which are all mental issues and it also has physical harm, which is shown in Tommy's death. We also see how Martin goes through a change do to multiple variables. Early in the film, we see how Martin is sad and just seems dull. At the seventeen minute mark we see how Martin is teaching and we see how dry his lectures are. Martin shows a lack of emotions and just has really low energy and is not responding to the criticism. Aside from just professional sadness, we also see this in his personal life too. He does not look happy in his marriage and nothing excites him. This scene is like a build up of the film since it shows how sad Martin is all before alcohol enters the film. We then get a switch up and we see that Martin changes from depressed to a happier more lively person. At the one hour and fifty minute mark we see that Martin is now a lot more lively. He danced with other people and he appears joyful. We see this from his smiles, and just his body movement.  He now shows emotion and shows genuine joy and excitement. He is no longer a slow moving, sluggish guy, he moves like his life has purpose. In the end, I think the insight that Martin gains is that being satisfied doesn't just come from temporarily suspending disaffection, it comes from connecting back with life. The final message of this movie for a lesson towards life is that you should live with confidence and courage instead of fear. Alcohol does not improve life, and growth and rebirth comes from re finding his joy and interests.",80,"
Hi Ryan,

You articulated a powerful insight in your conclusion: that satisfaction comes from ""connecting back with life"" rather than just escaping it. Your contrast between Martin's ""sluggish"" body language early in the film and his purposeful movement at the end was also very effective.

However, please pay closer attention to the assignment details regarding timestamps. You should cite the specific video file and time (e.g., ""Video 1, 17:00"") rather than just writing ""the seventeen minute mark."" Additionally, your timestamps were a bit off. The classroom scene is earlier in Video 1. Your cited timestamps actually correspond to when Martin has dinner at the restaurant with his friends.

Additionally, you concluded that ""growth and rebirth comes from refinding his joy."" While mostly correct, please include the fact that Martin is drinking alcohol during the final dance. The ending is ambiguous. 

Lastly, proofread for homophones and phrasing. You wrote ""do to multiple variables"" instead of ""due to,"" and your opening sentence (""In the film... the movie starts off"") is slightly repetitive.

Overall, good work!"
3,"While watching Another Round, Martin is visibly depressed and secluded from himself. This is seen starting at minute 10:15, when his wife, Anika, shuts him out and puts “work” before him. As someone who has been cheated on in past relationships, I can tell that this was one big indicator of being cheated on, and I think Martin knew this but was too naive and scared to admit it to himself. However, after a night out with his friends and getting too intoxicated, he couldn’t get to his own home and had his son take him inside. While having dinner, his wife disclosed that she had been seeing someone else (minute 80:39).

Martin, while depressed at the beginning, later found a change, and that was after he and his three friends decided to try Finn Skårderud’s theory of having an alcohol content of 0.05 (minute 13:34). In theory, if you have this amount of alcohol content, it would make you “hear the birds better.” Martin, starting the next day, was more energetic and enthusiastic with his class, which made the students want to learn and pay attention more, and it was evident that this was having a positive effect on him.

I think the insight Martin gains that allows him to grow is realizing how unhappy and disconnected he was from his life. At the beginning of the movie, he is clearly depressed and secluded from himself, especially in his marriage and his job as a teacher. After trying Finn Skarderud’s theory, Martin starts to feel more alive and energetic, which helps him realize that he was capable of change. This is mostly seen through his teaching, where he becomes more enthusiastic with his class, making the students want to learn and pay attention more. This change helped Martin grow and feel like himself again.

The final message of the movie is about your attitude toward life and living. Life can get dull and repetitive if you shut yourself off emotionally. While drinking alcohol is not the solution, the movie shows that if you take risks. Doing so can make things a bit more exciting, and maybe you can find your true self, feel more alive, and possibly find happiness when you are at an all-time low.",93,"
Hi Daxton,

Your personal connection to the scene where Anika shuts Martin out was very powerful.

However, be careful with your choice of timestamps. The prompt asked: Please cite a scene in the film that shows him being depressed or unmotivated and a scene that showcases his changed, happier, and more inspired attitude. For example, it would be better if you elaborate on specific moments where Martin is ""energetic and enthusiastic with his class."" Instead of just saying it happened, describe the scene—for example, the ""Churchill"" lesson where he engages the students in a guessing game. Specific details make for a much stronger argument.

Also, watch out for sentence fragments. In your conclusion, you wrote, ""the movie shows that if you take risks."" This is an incomplete thought. Finally, ""secluded from himself"" is a bit awkward; ""disconnected"" or ""dissociated"" would be more precise.

Overall, good work!"
3,"Martin starts to wonder about himself and feels sad and depressed after a student walked out of his class. After dinner, his wife goes to leave for work and he asked her, “Have I become boring?” to which she replies, “You are not the same Martin I first met”. (Video 1, 6 minutes and 50 seconds). This seems to really hurt him, but he just scoffs and says okay. Later, at dinner, his friends said that he thinks Martin lacks self-confidence and joy, which can also be due to being depressed. (Video 1, 15 minutes and 42 seconds) This saying coming from a friend especially can only hurt more and make his current feelings worse. I think that the aftermath of the conversation with his wife took a toll on him. She admitted to him that she was cheating on him, and he walked out angrily saying, “No one needs to wait on me”. He then goes to his friend's house to drink, where they all get way too drunk (Video 3, 22 minutes and 55 seconds). They then are all sitting around, hurt and in silence. Seeing Tommy struggle to even walk around at the school meeting, I think was a wake-up moment for Martin and his friends. The meeting was about teachers drinking alcohol, which many of them were. (Video 3, 25 minutes and 11 seconds). He then helps his friend home, as he is still unable to use his motor functions. In video 4 at 9 minutes and 12 seconds, he tells his last student that he got a B on the exam. They then go out and celebrate, and Martin is seen smiling and alert; he does not appear to be under any influences. I believe that the night with his friends that went overboard and seeing Tommy in that state made him realize that being an alcoholic is not the answer",87,"
Hi Bianca,

You did a great job selecting the specific dialogue that hurt Martin the most. 

However, your essay reads more like a chronological list of scenes rather than an argument about his growth. Instead of just listing what happened, explain why it matters. Additionally, you wrote that he ""does not appear to be under any influences,"" but if you look closely at Video 4, he is drinking alcohol while dancing. You need to analyze this complexity. 

Additionally, watch out for run-on sentences and awkward phrasing like ""This saying coming from a friend especially can only hurt more."" Try to be more direct: ""Hearing this from a friend is particularly painful.""

4,"Beatrice, our first main character, is presented as an eccentric and manic woman who lives in delusion of being someone in high society. She was married to a successful attorney and lived a lavish life until she threw it all away to be with her 'love', Renato, a criminal. Renato manipulated her into becoming an accomplice and stole all her money. This betrayal affected her mentally and she was deemed mentally unfit to live in society and was eventually sent to Villa Biondi.

Although it may seem that Renato caused her psychological collapse, I believe that Beatrice's mother is the root of all her mental issues. Her mother's coldness suggests that she was always strict with her daughter, always having high expectations from her and wanted her to succeed in high society and maintain their social standing at all costs. After Beatrice's scandal, her mother's coldness towards her increased. She treated her daughter's mental illness more as a flaw she can easily fix rather than something Beatrice suffers from. From the scene where they visit Beatrice's mother, it can be seen how the mother treats Beatrice like an inconvenience to be dealt with rather than a loved one visiting. The inherent lack of maternal instinct and the lack of love from her mother caused Beatrice to always be in the delusion that she is everything her mother always wanted her to be.

Donatella is introduced to us as a depressed young girl who had a suicide attempt and is later reveled to be a mother who was separated from her son. While their lives contrasted heavily, both Donatella and Beatrice had cold, unforgiving mothers who saw their daughters as weak and bad decision makers. Her father, although not a bed person, was always absent in her life. It can be seen how much she loves him but he only shows affection when it favours him. He was to blame for her childhood of poverty and lack of support systems which lead to a string of bad decision.

The scene at the beach (Video 3, 18:30), where they sit and discuss how their lives came to that point. Beatrice expresses how everyone would be happy if she died but Donatella follows up with what will she do if Beatrice isn't here. ",96,"
Hi Areebah,

You did an excellent job analyzing the root of Beatrice's trauma, specifically identifying that her mother's coldness and high expectations were likely more damaging than her relationship with Renato. 

While the beach scene (Video 3) was the perfect choice to illustrate their bond, I'd like to know why you chose it. Elaborating on your reasoning would make this essay even stronger.

Additionally, please proofread your work carefully before submitting. You wrote that Donatella's father was ""not a bed person,"" when you likely meant ""bad person."" Additionally, your final paragraph begins with a sentence fragment (""The scene at the beach...""). 

Overall, great work!"
4,"Donatella and Beatrice both have issues with their families. Briefly describe how each family has contributed to the women's mental health issues.

Donatella mental health struggles, including her depression and suicidal tendencies, are driven by abandonment and dysfunction. Her father abandoned her and viewed her as an embarrassment, and burden due to her illness. He refused to help her even when she asked for his support. Donatella and her mother does not have the best relationship as it is somewhat hostile. They argue, fight and have passive-aggressive behavior towards one another. Her mother does not make the circumstances better by telling her that she belongs in a mental hospital.

Beatrice's manic , delusional, and bipolar behavior is framed within the context of social pressure and rejection by her family. With her coming from an affluent family , that held her to high-standards her family rejected her when she did not live up to those high-standards. As her actions brought shame upon the families name. The family excluded her, and her mother expressed a lack of love or care for which contributed significantly to her bad mental state.

Describe one scene in which Donatella and Beatrice realize that they can handle life as long as they have their friendship.  Indicate, using a time stamp, where in the film this comes up (e.g., Video 2 at 12 min 30 seconds).

Starting at 2 minutes up until 5 minutes and 31 seconds of the third video, after escaping the facility, Donatella secretly goes to Beatrice's house and finds her lying in bed, visibly ill, emotionally drained and not acting in the super confident person persona that she has grown to know. When Beatrice says ""I'm happy you've come, I missed you."" In this moment, Beatrice realizes that she does not need to pretend. In this scene Donatella forces Beatrice to confront her insecurities and she chooses to be vulnerable. She quietly says ""I'm happy you've come, I missed you,"" it signals a turning point as Beatrice is no longer performing or seeking validation through status. Donatella's presence alone is enough. For Donatella, this moment is equally powerful. She is no longer the unwanted daughter or the difficult patient, but someone who is needed and chosen. The scene shows that their bond provides genuine, emotional support, trust and understanding as she drags her out of her dark place. Beatrice realizes that she is understood and has emotional support, and can trust Donatella even at her lowest point, in her most fragile state as Donatella provides her with stability.
",92,"
Hi Larry, 

You did a wonderful job analyzing the shift in Beatrice's character, specifically noting how she stops ""performing"" to Donatella.

When understanding Donatella's mental health, you need to include Donatella's son in your analysis. The film revolves around her desperate need to be a mother again. 

Additionally, you wrote the essay as two separate chunks corresponding to the prompt questions. Please try to make one coherent essay. Use transition words to connect your analysis of their pasts to the scene of their friendship. 

Lastly, proofread your work carefully before submitting. There are several grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and misssing possessives.

4,"In Like Crazy, both Donatella and Beatrice struggle with mental health issues that are
deeply connected to their family backgrounds. Donatella’s difficulties come from
emotional neglect and instability within her family. From what we learn, she grows up
without consistent care or validation, which leaves her feeling unwanted and
disconnected. Her family does not provide a sense of safety or belonging, contributing to
her low self-worth and difficulty trusting others. This lack of emotional support helps
explain why Donatella often appears withdrawn, insecure, and unsure of her place in the
world. Her mental health struggles seem tied to the feeling that she was never fully cared
for or understood at home.
Beatrice’s family issues are different but almost equally damaging. She comes from a
wealthy and socially prominent family, yet that privilege masks deep emotional neglect
and pressure. Her family prioritizes status, appearance, and reputation over her emotional
well-being. Beatrice is constantly expected to maintain a certain image, and when she fails
to meet those expectations, she is dismissed rather than supported. This contributes to
her manic behavior, denial, and tendency to live in fantasy. Her family’s refusal to
genuinely listen to her or acknowledge her pain reinforces her sense of isolation and
worsens her mental health condition.
One important scene where Donatella and Beatrice realize they can face life as long as
they have each other occurs near the end of the film, when they are sitting together by the
sea after their journey in Video 3 at around 13 minutes. In this moment, there is a
noticeable shift in their dynamic. They are calmer, more honest, and emotionally
grounded. Beatrice acknowledges her vulnerability, while Donatella expresses a sense of
belonging she has never truly felt before. The scene shows that, despite their ongoing
struggles, they have found stability and strength in their friendship. This moment
emphasizes that healing does not necessarily come from family approval or societal
acceptance, but from genuine human connection. Their friendship gives both emotional
support and understanding they lacked in their families, suggesting that shared empathy
can be just as life-sustaining as traditional family structures.
",97,"Hi Isaiah, 

You articulated the theme of friendship beautifully. 

However, your analysis of Donatella's family background was a bit generic. While you mentioned ""emotional neglect,"" the film specifically highlights the trauma involving her son and how her parents failed to support her during that crisis. Including these specific plot details would strengthen your argument.

Overall, great job! "
4,"Both Donatella and Beatrice endure mental health struggles that are deeply rooted in experience with their family. Their families play a major role in their psychological instability. Donatella’s family is part of the poor working-class and treated Donatella as a burden for them. They emotionally neglected her. They treat her like a problem rather than a human being. They didn’t try to support her when she was taken away from her by social services. Her family’s lack of understanding and support contributed to feelings of anger, worthlessness, and emotional instability. These feelings heightened her depression. Beatrice, on the other hand, comes from a wealthy family. Her parents were more concerned with their social status and their appearance as a family. Instead, they placed her in a mental health facility which intensified her denial of reality and manic episodes. They treat Beatrice as an embarrassment who has to be hidden to protect their family image. Her family’s rejection of her makes her feel unloved. Her experience with her family fuels her impulsive behavior and her need to be important. Although they come from different social backgrounds, both go through similar experiences that cause them to struggle with mental health. Throughout spending time with each other, Donatella and Beatrice realize they can handle life as long as they have their friendship. There is a moment towards the end of the film where Donatella says “Good thing I have you!” to Beatrice at the beach (Video 3 at 18 min 33 seconds). They embrace each other in a hug at the end of this moment. In this emotional moment, they comfort each other and accept their experience with their family. The specific scene shows growth in not only their friendship, but in themselves. Throughout this whole adventure, their friendship eventually substituted the love they never received from their family. ",99,"Hi Angelina, 

You did a great job contrasting the specific ways each family failed these women. 

One small note for clarity: in the sentence ""They didn't try to support her when she was taken away from her by social services,"" it is slightly unclear if you are referring to Donatella being institutionalized or her son being taken away. Be careful with pronoun references to make your meaning precise.

4,"1. In Like Crazy, both Donatella and Beatrice struggle with mental health issues that are closely connected to their family relatioships. Beatrice comes from a wealthy and powerful family where appearance, status, and reputation are prioritized over feelings. Her husband and in-laws treat her mental illness like it's more of an inconvenience to them, almost as a way to forget about her and control her. Instead of listening to her or offering any compassion or empathy, they isolate her and make decisions on her behalf without regard for her feelings. I believe this makes Beatrice struggle with internal validation and, in turn, fuels her manic behaviors.

Donatella's struggles stem from abandonment and pretty severe trauma. She comes from a working-class family and has experienced deep emotional pain after losing custody of her son. I don't think her family ever gave her the support she deserved, and because of that, she blames herself for her situation. I believe the absence of her family, and particularly her son, plays a major role in her emotional withdrawal.

2. At 34:50, when Donatelle and Beatrice are shopping in the mall and impulsively purchase Valium, the scene begins to feel more like a wild adventure. The moment reminded me almost of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where reckless behavior and drug use create a sense of chaotic yet stable friendship. When the women were chased in the mall by the hospital workers trying to take them back to the psychiatric hospital, they escaped together and terrifically, might I add. It looks as if the characters are having more fun than they ever have. I believe this symbolizes that both Beatrice and Donatella lack in the families they have found in each other, and that if they stick together, they will be able to rehabilitate properly. Their friendship makes life feel manageable for each other, despite what is being thrown at them or what they are dealing with from the past.",93,"
Hi Daniel, 

You did a very good job identifying and interpreting the moment Donatella and Beatrice solidified their friendship. 

However, for future assignments, please try to write a single coherent essay using transition words to connect your ideas, rather than numbering your answers. 

While you identified the major factors of their mental illness well, your analysis felt a bit generic at times; pinpointing specific scenes -- as you did for the shopping mall sequence -- will make your argument much stronger. For instance, regarding Beatrice's family, focus on her mother (who appears in the film and is crucial to Beatrice's illness due to her lack of empathy) rather than her in-laws. 

Finally, please ensure your timestamps indicate the specific video number (e.g., Video 2 at 34:50) for clarity.

4,"In the film Like Crazy, the main characters, Beatrice and Donatella, both suffer from mental health issues that are from abandonment and rejection of their own family. Donatella’s severe depression and suicidal tendencies are from the neglect that her father and her mother, who is emotionally distant and prioritizes financial convenience over her. However, Beatrice has bipolar disorder and manic delusions that are from her wealthy family’s decision to disown her entirely. Her spontaneous-ness is rooted from a defense mechanism against the reality of her family leaving her. Her family’s preoccupation with social status left Beatrice with a fractured identity, forcing her to rely on fantasies to cope with the fact that she has been discarded by her own family, which was her only support system. The two women eventually realize that while their families have failed them, their friendship provides the only support system they have left. This realization occurs during the final scene of them together outside of the mental institution in the movie, (Video 3 at 18 minutes and 48 seconds.) This final scene of them together outside of the mental institution is monumental to the plot because Donatella and Beatrice are both together, cherishing their friendship before Beatrice is taken back to the mental institution. Donatella runs to the beach. The beach scene is important because Donatella sees her son, Elia, who was there with his foster family. This scene provides Donatella with a sense of closure and she comes to the conclusion that she cannot be his mother full-time because of all the mental trauma she needs to work out. She eventually walks back to the mental institution and they share a look through the window. They had both been through a lot together in their friendship, shifting from a ""project"" to a genuine friendship along the entirety of the movie. ",95,"
Hi Kathryn, 

You offered a thoughtful insight into Beatrice's defense mechanism. 

While you correctly identified and cited the beach scene as a monumental moment, you didn't fully explain what happens in that moment to show their bond. How do they cherish their friendship together here? Interpreting their interaction would make your argument much stronger. 

Additionally, please pay closer attention to your vocabulary and phrasing in future assignments. For instance, the noun form of ""spontaneous"" is ""spontaneity,"" not ""spontaneous-ness."" 

Overall, great work on the analysis! "
4,"The families of both Donatella and Beatrice act in a way that contributes to their mental health issues. For example, Donatella's father refuses to help her and brushes her off, even when she calls him for help and to take care of her so she doesn't have to go back to a judicial hospital. Her mother, talks of how it must be nice to be paid to be institutionalized instead of asking how she is doing, she is the one who got her son taken away from her while knowing how important he is to Donatella's stability, and acts in such a passive aggressive way that it is hard to tell if she truly cares for her daughter or not. While in the film, we only really interact with Beatrice's mother, it is clear in the interaction she has with Donatella that she may recognize her daughter needs help, but she refuses to be the one to help her, wanting to get rid of her entirely or even saying she should kill herslef so she doesn't have to deal with the consequences of her daughters actions anymore. I think the end of the film (part 3, 27:40), when Beatrice sees Donatella back at the facility through the window it shows how much they have grown to mean to each other and how they believe that things will be better with the other in their life. Even though at this point they have both been through the ringer just within the course of the movie, going through things that are both emotionally and physically taxing, they find solace in knowing that they are with the other, seeing each other still manages to make them smile despite the fact that they end up right where they began.

4,"In “Like Crazy”, both Donatella and Beatrice struggle with their mental health, and a big
reason for that is their families. Donatella feels unwanted and abandoned for most of her life. Her
parents never really supported her, and later she is hurt badly by her relationship with Maurizio
and by being separated from her son, Elia. These experiences make her feel alone, sad, and
hopeless. Because she never feels truly loved or cared for by her family, Donatella has a hard
time believing things will get better.
Beatrice also has problems with her family, but in a different way. Even though her
family is rich, they are emotionally distant and controlling. Her mother and ex-husband treat her
like she is embarrassing or inconvenient instead of trying to understand her. Instead of getting
support, Beatrice is pushed aside and locked away, which makes her rely on fantasy and
exaggeration to cope. Her confident stories and dramatic behavior are a way for her to escape
feeling rejected by the people closest to her.
A scene that shows Donatella and Beatrice realizing they can handle life as long as they
have each other happens near the end of the movie, around 1 hour and 45 minutes. After their
escape fails and they are taken back to the psychiatric facility, the two sit together quietly. There
is no joking or pretending at this moment. They simply sit side by side, and it feels calm and
honest. This scene shows that even though life is still hard, their friendship gives them comfort
and helps them keep going.

4,"In the film “Like Crazy”, Donatella and Beatrice struggle with mental issues that are
strongly connected to their family backgrounds. Donatella’s difficulties stem largely from
neglect, instability, and a lack of emotional support within her family. She and her mother
had a complicated relationship, and her dad abandoned her. On top of that, she ended up
losing her son due to a judge and/or social workers ruling her unfit to parent. Her family
failed to provide consistency, care, or protection, leaving Donatella vulnerable to
unhealthy relationships and poor coping strategies. This absence of support plays a role in
her impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and sense that she has little control over her life.
On the other hand, Beatrice’s family issues are different but equally damaging. She comes
from a wealthy, high-status background where appearances, reputation, and success are
prioritized over emotional well-being. Rather than being neglected, Beatrice is emotionally
invalidated. Her family minimizes her mental health struggles and frames her behavior as
embarrassing or inconvenient instead of recognizing it as a need for help. This pressure to
maintain a perfect image contributes to Beatrice’s manic tendencies, bold thinking, and
refusal to accept her illness.
A key scene, in which Donatella and Beatrice realize they can face life together, occurs
toward the end of the film in Video 3, at approximately 11 minutes and 54 seconds. In this
scene, both Donatella and Beatrice have an opening-up moment. Donatella finally tells the
story of how she lost the privilege to see her son, and afterwards, Beatrice mentions how
she could sleep forever or die so that her mom could finally be happy. Donatella
responded to that message by letting Beatrice know that she has her; they have each
other, and that’s all they need. Although both women’s mental issues stemmed from
different places, their bond played a major role in them finally deciding to get the help they
needed.

4,"Both main characters, Beatrice and Donatella, face issues with their families. Beatrice's family makes her feel less like a person and more like a tool. Her family does not consider her feelings, and they make her seem like an inconvenience more than anything. They want to control her and pressure her into being a “proper” member of their family instead of taking time to understand how she feels. Beatrice feels that she cannot relax or open up about her problems around her family since they only care to have her end up ""proper"".  For Donatella, she has been neglected by her family for a long time. She lacks proper relationships with anyone in general which means when any relationship she manages to hold fails, it hurts her more than anything else. Her family has not bothered to help her with her problems, which has led to her problems only growing worse. Donatella feels that she is not wanted by her family, which only makes her feel worse and leads to her wanting to isolate herself. While both girls have their own issues, they come to realize that with each other they can manage to get through them and live life. In video 3 at 18:35, the two girls have a moment where they realize this and hug it out. They end up sleeping on a concrete wall together as they feel comfortable in each other's presence. The two have faced similar situations throughout their lives which give them stability through each other. They have both never truly had support in their lives and with each other, they believe that they are safe and cared for. Both of their families never gave them the support they needed in their tough times, so they decided to fill that gap with each other.

4,"In the film Like Crazy, Donatella and Beatrice both experience conflicts with their families, enduring many hardships alongside mental health issues. Through their struggles, they rely on each other for support and comfort, realizing that their friendship has grown stronger than their ties to their biological relatives. To begin, Donatella struggles with mental health, specifically depression, which causes her to lose custody over her son. As the father of her son left, her depression worsened, and she attempted suicide while holding her son. While they both survived, she was admitted to a psychiatric facility, and her son was adopted. Also, Donatella’s family contributed to her mental instability as they ignored her pleas and refused to take responsibility for her, offering money and distance instead of comfort and care. For instance, Donatella’s mom explains in the second video at 14 minutes and 10 seconds, “I did it for the good of the boy. It was only right. I couldn’t raise him. I worked all day; she was a mess. Depression is a brutal beast. A real family is better.” This explanation illustrates that Donatella’s parents only offered love from a distance, showing that their actions towards Donatella and her son were selfish but disguised as caring. This reinforced Donatella’s sense of loneliness. Moreover, Beatrice came from a wealthy background, but her family eventually became emotionally numb and unsupportive. Her mother was introduced in the film, talking about Beatrice to Donatella. At the beginning of the third video, Beatrice’s mother says, “You can’t imagine the havoc she has wrecked in our lives. She’s an egoistic liar. She’s been deceiving people her whole life, starting with us…I have no pity left for her; she should kill herself and put an end to it.” She then explained how Beatrice had led them to financial ruin and resentment. These instances illustrate the negative effects their families had on their mental stability. Finally, there is a scene in the film when Donatella and Beatrice realize they can handle life if they have their friendship. In the third video, at 18 minutes and 10 seconds, Beatrice confesses to Donatella that she feels it would be better if she were dead, saying, “my mom would finally be happy, everybody would be.” Donatella replies, “And what would I do?

For your next assignments, try to avoid using long direct quotes. You included three lengthy quotes in this essay. You can paraphrase the dialogue. Paraphrasing allows you to use more space for your own analysis and interpretation. 

Additionally, one minor note on vocabulary for future reference: the standard idiom is ""wreaked havoc,"" not ""wrecked havoc.""

4,"Donatella and Beatrice both struggle with mental health issues, strongly derived from their
past. Specifically, from their families, including how they failed to support, and even
understand them. Donatella got hers from the neglect and overall instability of her family.
She received little to no care or love from her family, leaving her to feel depressed and
alone. This followed her into adulthood, contributing to her substance abuse and general
mental health. Without a stable family foundation, Donatella grows up feeling invisible,
which worsens her emotional isolation and makes it difficult for her to trust herself or
others.
Beatrice, on the other hand, is rejected and abandoned by her in-laws. The failed marriage
and emotional abandonment she went through contributes to her becoming relatively
manic. She starts using fantasy and an extroverted persona to cover her inability to face
reality.
Near the end of the movie, (an hour and 30 minutes in) Donatella and Beatrice are at the
beach. Donatella starts showing her true feelings and pain. She talks about feeling
worthless and completely opens up to Beatrice. Beatrice then shows growth by actually
listening and comforting Donatella rather than putting on a facade. They then sit together,
signifying that they don't feel the need to run anymore because they are by each other's
side. Even though their families failed to support them, they won’t fail to support each
other.",84,"Hi Alina, 

You correctly identified that Beatrice uses her extroverted persona and fantasies as a shield against the pain of her family's rejection. 

However, you should have focused more on Beatrice's relationship with her mom than on her in-laws, who were absent from the film. 

Also, please try to be more precise with your timestamps rather than just giving a general time.

4,"Both Donatella and Beatrice have major issues with their families. Donatella very much so dislikes her mother. First, she got pregnant by her boyfriend before being fired from her job - as he was the owner. She then was forced to take care of this child, during this time having depression. Afterwards, she was forced in an institution after trying to kill herself and her son. her mother denied responsibility for the kid. This left her son to be set up for adoption. Her father rejected her, living out his own life and pursuing his personal future. Donatella always looked up to him and saw him as an idol, believing herself to be a nuisance to him. Beatrice fell for a criminal who sold properties that he did not own. She signed every paper he gave her and he caused her to end up with two counts of bankruptcy, leading her family to lose all of their money - forcing them to rent their house out to make money. She slept with an attorney and hoped he would get her boyfriend off scott free. Both her and her boyfriend received harsh penalties and were institutionalized. Both Donatella and Beatrice's ex's despise them. At 18:35 in the third video, the two have a deep, heartfelt talk. Donatella opens up to Beatrice. She explains what went wring in her life, wanting to be better. She explains how she got here, telling Beatrice how she tried to kill herself and her son so that they both could be together - and happy - forever. She mentioned how her son hated being away from her. At this time stamp, Donatella states how she needs Beatrice and Beatrice reciprocates these feeling, as they seem the only two in the world that could match each other's craziness. They share a heartfelt moment and realize that all they need is each other.",90,"Hi Christian, 

You did a great job identifying the shared trauma between Donatella and Beatrice. 

However, the essay reads more like a summary of the movie's events than an interpretation of the characters. You listed what happened to them, but you need to offer more interpretation of their family dynamics. For instance, regarding Beatrice: after you explain that she ""caused her family to lose all their money,"" elaborate that her family's reaction shows that they value social status more than their daughter's mental health. 

Additionally, please proofread your work more carefully before submitting. You had several mechanical errors, such as ""wring"" instead of ""wrong,"" and failing to capitalize the beginning of a sentence.

4,"In the film Like Crazy, Donatella and Beatrice’s mental health struggles result from their past, revealing how trauma and neglect can affect you in your adult life.. Donatella suffers from the absence of stable family support, particularly in her relationship with her son. Being separated from him creates intense guilt, anxiety, and emotional vulnerability, which drive her impulsive decisions, such as fleeing the facility. Her family’s inability to provide consistent care and guidance leaves her without a foundation, proving how the lack of nurturing relationships can cause problems, even as an adult. Beatrice, on the other hand, carries the weight of trauma from both her mother AND an ex-husband. Her mother is controlling and not really present, while her ex-husband triggers her insecurities, causing her to have confidence issues and leaving her isolated. These family dynamics feed into Beatrice’s, delusions, dramatic, attention-seeking behaviors. The film illustrates how trauma from family relationships, especially at a young age, can manifest as compulsive behaviors and mental health struggles in adulthood. Despite their hard family backgrounds, the film emphasizes that friendship can serve as a way to bounce back. The scene I chose occurs at the beach in the third video about 11 minutes in, after Donatella swims with her son, Elia. Following this emotional encounter, she and Beatrice sit together, quietly reflecting on their what's happened to them. Here, they realize that even though their families have caused pain and instability, their friendship gives them the support and understanding needed to deal with their issues. The connection between the two women becomes a staple, allowing them to have some fun while going through the hard times. Overall, the film absolutely shows the idea of trauma bonding, and through trust and friendship, shows how it's an effective way to go through any kind of childhood struggles.

 ",82,"Hi Luke, 

Your term ""trauma bonding"" was an excellent description of this film. 

However, there is a factual error in your essay. Donatella does not swim with her son in the scene you cited. This happens the day after Beatrice and Donatella had a night on the beach.

Additionally, your analysis of family dynamics reads a bit general. For example, you mentioned Donatella's ""impulsive decisions, such as fleeing the facility,"" but you missed the root cause: her suicide attempt. Elaborating on this would fully explain her trauma. 

Lastly, please proofread your work more carefully next time. You have some awkward phrasing, such as ""reflecting on their what's happened to them,"" and ""staple"" seems to be the wrong word choice for the context. Also, watch out for punctuation errors like double periods and unnecessary capitalization (e.g., ""AND"").

4,"The film ""Like Crazy"" portrays the depression and despair of two girls from completely different backgrounds. Beatrice, a girl from a wealthy and luxurious family, has an indifferent mother and a capable but controlling husband. Her mother's indifference and coldness are most evident in the scene in which Beatrice returns to her parents' home, and Donatella finds her. When Donatella speaks to Beatrice's mother, instead of greeting her and asking how she's been since she last saw her daughter, she shows disgust and contempt, treating Beatrice as a problem to be solved. Besides her strained relationship with her mother, Beatrice also has a broken marriage with her wealthy lawyer husband. Because of her infidelity, her marriage broke down, and he was also the one who sent her to a mental institution. Having lived a life of luxury, her life in the mental institution was completely turned upside down, which was a huge shock for her. Upon returning to her old home, she witnessed her ex-husband entering a new relationship.
Unlike Beatrice, Donatella did not come from a wealthy and privileged background. However, she had a relatively good relationship with her father, a pianist. Donatella's mother was also very caring, as seen in the scene where she came to pick up Donatella and Beatrice; she was very happy and asked many questions about her daughter, in contrast to Beatrice's mother's reaction. However, her depression stemmed from Donatella's toxic relationship with the man named Maurizio and the separation from her son. Because she was deemed to have mental health issues and unfit to care for her child, she was not given direct custody of her son. During a visit to the amusement park with her son, she encountered Maurizio, who insulted her, accusing her of sleeping with many men and questioning the paternity of the child. Deeply distraught, she decided to jump into the river with her son. Although she was rescued, she was accused of attempted suicide and attempted murder. From then on, she never saw her son again, her grief and guilt plunging her into despair.
The scene showing the two characters realizing they can handle anything with their friendship is when they are sitting on the beach before the people from the mental institution arrive to take them away, in the third video at 18 minutes 35 seconds. Donatella says, ""Good thing I have you,"" when Beatrice says everyone will be happy when she dies, and then the two hug. This scene doesn't explicitly state that they will overcome their difficulties together, but from their words and actions, it's clear that they now see a positive aspect in their lives: having each other.",91,"Hi Gia, 

You selected a perfect scene for the ending. 

You described Donatella's father as having a ""relatively good relationship"" with her and her mother as ""very caring."" While it can be valid to some extent, Donatella's father is emotionally absent and offers her no help. Her mother is portrayed as burdened and resentful; she is the one who refused to take custody of Donatella's son. Describing them as a happy, caring support system misses the tragedy of Donatella's isolation. 

Additionally, try to stay within the required word range (300-400 words).

4,"Donatella and Beatrice both struggle with mental health issues that are deeply connected to their family experiences. Although their lives were completely different in many ways, they were still connected through a deep bond of trauma. Their experiences were very different, yet they both had to struggle and deal with so much. Donatella’s problems stem from her childhood, which was marked by neglect, emotional abuse, and a lack of protection from her family. Not growing up with people who truly cared about her or made her feel safe in a healthy environment pushed her toward self destructive and impulsive behavior. The lack of support in her life gave her feelings of abandonment and low self worth, which later made it even harder for her to manage her emotions. Her family failed to provide safety or validation, which later played a key role in her struggles and attachment issues, especially in her relationship with her son.

On the other hand, Beatrice’s mental health issues are tied to the collapse of her marriage and her family’s rejection. Although she lived a life of luxury, money, property, and privilege that matched her status as a wife, everything changed after her mental breakdown. Her husband decided to leave her, and not only did she lose her relationship with him, but she also lost her identity, her social circle, and everything connected to that life. Through denial, her delusions were fueled, and rather than accepting her situation, Beatrice clung to fantasies about her past life as a way to cope with humiliation, loneliness, and emotional loss. These struggles were caused by her family and her husband, who failed to give her the care, love, and support she needed most.

One of the most powerful scenes between Donatella and Beatrice is when they realize that with their friendship, they can make it through life. The scene I chose is when Donatella tells Beatrice how she almost committed suicide while holding her son, how her son was taken away, and how she fell into deep depression as shown in Video 4 . Beatrice then opens up about everything she has experienced in her own life. Together, they reflect on everything they have been through and recognize that the world, especially their families, has often failed them. Despite this, they find comfort and strength in each other. Their bond provides stability, understanding, and hope, showing that the friendship they built throughout the movie allows them to face life with greater resilience than either of them ever could alone, especially when Donatella returns to therapy and rehab.",90,"
Hi Daniel, 

You have a good grasp of the emotional themes of the movie. You correctly identified that Beatrice uses ""fantasies about her past life as a way to cope with humiliation."" That is a great insight. 

However, your essay reads a bit too generally. You talk about ""emotional abuse"" and ""abandonment"" without giving specific examples from the movie. For example, instead of saying Donatella's family ""failed to provide safety,"" mention specifically that her mother let her son be adopted because she didn't want the burden. 

Additionally, try to stay within the required word range (300-400 words). 

Lastly, please include a timestamp in your text (e.g., Video 4, 12:07) rather than providing a screenshot. 

Overall, good work! "
4,"Throughout the film, both Donatella and Beatrice struggle with their mental health. Both their families seem to be the root of these problems. Donatella's family is extremely judgemental and controlling, and they tend to offer her little support when she needs it. This can be shown when she leaves the institution she's in. Beatrice's struggles stem from her dysfunctional relationships with her family and ex husband. It makes her feel alone and isolated throughout the movie, and feeds her delusions of her being connected to a powerful figure. Both women highlight the importance of family support, and how detrimental it can be when there is no healty relationships with family members. 

However, the women realize that through a healthy, meaningful friendship, they can both heal from their tramuatic experiences. In the scene where Donatella swins with her son Elia (1:05:20), the two women are able to relax and share a deep, eyeopening conversation. They offer each other support, free of judgement and accept each other for who the other person really is. Even though their day was chaotic and unpredictable, they both had each other to keep them grounded. By the end of the scene the women have gained a new found sense of trust in each other, which allows them to feel more confident in facing lives ups and downs.  The film overall shows that even though things like family matters can deeply effect mental health, there will always be found family to lean on during the hard times. ",81,"
Hi Erin, 

You correctly identified the beach scene with Elia as a pivotal moment for Donatella's healing and the bond between the two women. 

However, at 250 words, this essay falls below the required word count. You need to elaborate significantly on your points to meet the requirements. For example, you mentioned Beatrice's ""dysfunctional relationships,"" but specific details about her ex-husband and her mother would strengthen your argument. 

Additionally, please proofread for spelling and grammatical errors. I'd recommend using Word.

4,"   In the movie ""Like Crazy"", Donatella and Beatrice both struggle with mental health issues that are deeply influenced by their family relationships. Even though they have different family problems, they share a common trait of their families contributing to their unstable mental conditions of pressure, neglect, and lack of care.

   Donatella's mental health is heavily influenced by her feelings of abandonment and emotional isolation. She has grown up without support her entire life and has learned to expect abandonment from the people she trusts the most. Her relationship with her previous partner and his family made things worse for her; she was treated as replaceable once she failed to fit his expectations. The feeling of rejection makes Donatella insecure and convinced that she is not worth staying with. The fact that her family was not present to show her care and love has led Donatella to a low sense of self-worth.

   Beatrice, on the other hand, comes from a wealthy family with a high social status. Because of this, her mental health worsens due to the failure of all these factors to satisfy her emotional needs. Beatrice's family never offers emotional support in dealing with her condition; they only care about her effect on their social status and how to manage her for their own benefit. This pushes Beatrice further away from reality and into isolation. 

   One scene in this movie is where Donatella and Beatrice realize they can face life as long as they have each other, which is in video 2, at 12 minutes and 30 seconds. This occurs when Beatrice steps into the hallway while talking about the will of an older man whose children never visit him. Beatrice also confidently talks about why she would have the right to the property if anything were to happen to the owner. She goes on and thinks about how she would own the place herself someday. This scene is important because it shows that even if Beatrice's ideas are unrealistic, she goes on to talk about the importance of owning the place to take care of Donatella. Donatella listened quietly and did not reject the idea of being taken care of. This scene shows the importance of friendship and how their friendship gave them courage and comfort, showing that even without family support, they can rely on each other to face life. ",85,"
Hi Sarah, 

You did a great job contrasting the different types of family neglect. Your analysis of how this impacts their self-worth is very insightful. 

However, when it comes to specific family dynamics, your analysis reads a bit vague. For example, you mentioned Donatella's ""previous partner and his family"" treating her as replaceable. Donatella's trauma is centered on the father of her child, and more importantly, her own mother, who refused to take custody of the grandson after Donatella's suicide attempt. For your next assignments, try to be more specific with evidence. 

Additionally, your cited timestamp (Video 2, 12:30) is when Donatella's mom says she's going to inherit the general's house and money so she can help her daughter. What you described about Beatrice (""confidently talks about why she would have the right to the property if anything were to happen to the owner."") doesn't appear in your cited timestamp.

4,"Donatella and Beatrice's families contribute to both characters mental health issues in similar and contrasting ways. Both woman feel rejected by their families and suffer from losses and failures in their lives. Beatrice comes from a wealthy family. Beatrice's mother explains to Donatella that Beatrice is an egotistical liar and deceives people. She is also gullible, falling for a man named Renato who takes advantage of her and her families wealth. Her mother is dismissive and unsupportive, and the family places Beatrice in a mental health facility because she continues to cause them financial troubles. As a result of losing her family and wealthy status, Beatrice copes by living in denial, making up fantasies about her life still being the same, and acting erratically. Donatella doesn't come from wealth. Her family abandons her and doesn't offer support for her son. The father of her child wants nothing to do with either of them. She is deemed unfit to care for her son and loses custody of him. Donatella is institutionalized and suffers from depression. She is alone and feels like a failure. She essentially deprives herself by not taking take of herself, such as refusing to eat and abusing her medication.
One scene in which Donatella and Beatrice realize that they can handle life as long as they have their friendship occurs at the end of the movie, when they talk to each at the beach (Video 3, 11:25). While sitting together near the beach, they come to terms with their lives. Donatella begins to accept that reconnecting with her son is not possible. She opens up to Beatrice about what led to her losing custody of him. Beatrice listens to Donatella's admission of depression and responds several times with the phrase ""Me too."" This suggest Beatrice is accepting that her past life is gone. In this scene they are no longer lying about or running from their problems. Instead, they are truly accepting and understanding each other. This scene shows that regardless of the damage and loss caused by their families (and their own actions), their friendship provides the acceptance and support needed for them to move forward.",92,"
Hi Nelson, 

You did a great job contrasting the family dynamics. Your analysis of the beach scene as a moment of mutual acceptance is also very touching. 

While your analysis of Beatrice's family dynamics is comprehensive, your analysis of Donatella is missing one important part: her mom. Donatella's mom is the primary antagonist who was present in the movie and refused to take custody of Donatella's son after the suicide attempt.

4,"Donatella’s struggles are rooted in neglect from her parents. Her parents divorced “ages ago” (clip 2 at 5:26), and her relationship with her mother is unstable and hostile. This becomes clear at 14:47, when Donatella and her mother begin arguing and screaming at each other. This conflict prevents Donatella from developing emotional security, reinforcing her idea that she is a burden rather than someone deserving care. Donatella’s father also plays a damaging role. When she is hospitalized, the doctor says she could be released if “her father takes wardship of her,” but another woman responds, “he abandoned her years ago” (23:15). When Donatella finally confronts him, he refuses responsibility and tells her, “You need to learn to take care of yourself” (24:13). Donatella desperately reminds him, “You were so important to me,” but he dismisses her memories and leaves for a concert (24:29). This moment shows how Donatella’s emotional needs are minimized, explaining her desperation for love and her difficulty functioning independently. Her visit to a psychic, where she asks,  “Does [my son] know I think about him?” reflects how deeply she longs for reassurance and connection (clip 1 40:30). 

Beatrice’s mental health issues are shaped by emotional cruelty and rejection, despite coming from wealth. She fantasizes about finding happiness in “places with linen tablecloths and good wine in crystal glasses” (Clip 2 at 1:27), which reflects her upbringing among privilege and luxury. However, her wealth does not protect her from emotional damage; it allows her family to hide their dysfunction behind status and money. She speaks bitterly about her father, calling him “a f–, a homo, a butt-f—er” (5:50), revealing deep unresolved anger. Her mother is openly abusive, calling Beatrice “an egoistic liar” (Clip 3 at 0:27) and saying she “should kill herself and put an end to it” (1:33). This emotional violence helps explain Beatrice’s grandiosity, denial, and exaggerated self-image, which function as defenses against rejection.

A key moment showing that Donatella and Beatrice realize they can survive because of their friendship occurs at 18:05 in clip 3. Beatrice says, “Or even die. So my mom would finally be happy,” and Donatella responds, “Are you crazy? And what would I do?” They then say, “Good thing I have you… Good thing you have me.”This exchange marks a turning point because, instead of seeing themselves as burdens, both women recognize that they matter deeply to someone else. Their bond is real, unlike the emotional distance shown by their families. Friendship here becomes their chosen family, giving them stability, validation, and hope that allows them to face the hardships of life.",92,"Hi Madison, 

You did a great job contrasting the socioeconomic backgrounds of the two women while highlighting their shared emotional neglect. 

However, for your next assignment, try to paraphrase more. You quoted almost every interaction. It is better to summarize the plot points in your own words and save the direct quotes for the lines that carry the emotional weight of the film (like the final exchange on the beach).

4,". Donatella and Beatrice both have very complicated relationships with their parents that seemingly had an impact on their mental health. (11:38) One of the interactions that showed this was when Donatella’s mother came to pick them up. At first she seems really nice by picking them up at a time of need and offering them a place to stay at. We later discover that she is the reason why her daughter’s son got taken away from her and all she really cares about is money. In the beginning, Donatella also seems extremely fond of her father, making him seem like this awesome pianist who is always busy. (23:54) As the film progresses, we find out that he actually abandoned her years ago. When he showed up at the hospital, he basically told his daughter to take care of herself while she was unwell because he was more concerned with himself. It becomes very obvious that Donatella feels like a burden to her own father as she also expresses it later. The film also mentions how Donatella’s parents are divorced. On the other hand, there is not much said about Beatrice’s father except the fact that he is gay and still married to her mother. (1:34) Beatrice’s mother also seems pretty evil considering how she thinks her own daughter should kill herself. I can imagine how all this took a toll on both of their mental healths growing up, and even currently as they are still not supported by the people who are supposed to be there for them the most. 

b. (18:42) One scene I found particular in which Donatella and Beatrice realize that they can handle life as long as they have their friendship was when they were sitting by the beach and having a heartfelt moment after Donetalla finally opened up to Beatrice about her son. Throughout the film, the two had a really confusing relationship but towards the end we can see how they both really care for each other in their own way. I think along the way they were also certainly slowly establishing trust within each other but Donatella’s confession was the exact moment that they knew everything about each other including all the bad, which made their friendship even stronger. They both additionally express how they are glad to have each other in that same scene.    ",94,"Hi Selen, 

You did a great job analyzing the toxic dynamic of Donatella's parents, specifically noting how her mother's greed and her father's selfishness contributed to her instability. 

I have a few suggestions for your next assignments: 

1) Your essay feels a bit disjointed because you separated it with bullet points. Try to make one coherent essay rather than treating the prompt as a list of questions. You can use transition words to connect your ideas into a conclusion. 

2) Please ensure you include the specific video number in your timestamps (e.g., Video 1, 11:38) for clarity. 

3) Be careful with your grammar. For example, ""Mental health"" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized as ""mental healths."" 

Overall, good work on the analysis! "
4,"In this film, the introduction of depression and poor mental health is emphasized and evaluated through the perspectives and embodiment of two different individuals. We see how money and coming from wealth still do not guarantee happiness and security in life through Beatrice. We also see how the value of family can the mistakes of one's past can destroy a person's ability to forgive and move on in life through Donatella. With Beatrice, her family never truly valued her humanity enough to want to reach out and help her, instead of identifying her mental health issues, seen in her lack of control over her emotions, and helping her find true help. They isolated her because of embarrassment. She is not worthy of their title and status, so they leave her to fend for herself. This is probably why she felt so comfortable stealing from the ones she loves, because they never showed her concern and true care. Donatella, she is kind of the opposite; she did not come from much, but her relationship with her ex was highly abusive and caused her to fall into a deep depression. A mother's love for a child is described to be one of the strongest loves to ever exist, so when she because severelly depressed after she became pregnant by her abuser, she became a danger to her own child. When her child is taken away from her, guilt and sadness grow inside her, and she feels that she is unworthy of life. Both these women suffer from neglect and the feeling of true love from others, but when they come together, it is almost like they see one another on a deeper level.  In Video 3 at 18 mins and 4 secs - 18 mins and 45 seconds, Beatrice and Donatella have a heart-to-heart. Although they both struggle mentally, they realize that with eachother life is manageable and that if one died, the other would not know what to do without them. This friendship shows the growth of the character Donatella, as she hears Beatrice say she would be better off dead, Donatella realizes that they do not deserve to die, and that at the very least, they have each other.

Question B
In this scene, Donatella and Beatrice are sitting by a beach, drinking beer, and talking about their past lives. Donatella recounts her attempted suicide and the homicide of Elias, her son. She takes Beatrice through the day while adding her emotions, thoughts, and why she attempted. Beatrice relates, stating they are tired women, to which Donatella nods. Beatrice starts to talk about how she would be better off dead than sleeping for a long duration, claiming her mom would be happier. Donatella tells her she would be sad if she died. This instance is the climax of the movie. The women are both obviously in need of professional help and need people like each other to support them to and through their goals. Finding solace in someone who understands what you're going through is a relieving experience, and this movie captures that aspect wonderfully.
Question A
Both women have familial troubles. Beatrice is ostracized by her family because of how rambunctious and uncouth she can be. Even her mother is sick of her antics.  From this, Beatrice has a deep depression and other personality disorders. The way she interacts with people she deems as ""lower"" gives the viewer evidence of her conditions. Her family treats her like she's not worth the effort to help as well. In my opinion, this is what amplifies Beatrice's conditions.
Donatella had a child whom she lost due to her mental instability. On the day she attempted suicide, she discovered her husband had another family. Not only did it kill her joy, but it also the last straw that made Donatella think there was so much pain in the world that ending her and her baby's lives would be a better option. Donatella experienced a lot of neglect growing up too. Her mother treated her like she wasn't worth her time, constantly being reminded by the words her mother spat at her. Both of these traumas greatly contributed to her mental health as we see it in the film.",88,"
Hi Samantha, 

You did a great job capturing the emotional core of female friendship. 

However, be careful with the details. You referred to the father of Donatella's child as her ""husband."" They were not married, which is part of why her parents were so judgmental of her situation. 

Additionally, for future assignments, try to weave your answers into a single cohesive essay rather than separating them into ""Question A"" and ""Question B."" Your cited timestamp should also be included within the text.

They each go about dealing with their own attachment in different ways, but each very clearly has a special place held for their family land and inheritance. Jean is the one who immediatley wants to sell, and from his decision to leave in the past, his siblings both worry he won't change his mind. I believe a key part of Jean deciding not to sell was reading the letter from his father, video 2 26:16, it becomes clear to him that his family always did care about him, even if he felt like they didn't. This realization makes it harder for him to sell, especially after his son comes to visit. In video 1 32:23, Juliet expresses how she doesn't feel like a boss, how maybe she isn't cut out for this, and should sell. Her brother quickly tells her that if she loves wine, then she should make wine, encouraging her to stick to what she enjoys even though he personally is interested in selling. Juliet is really only confident when it comes to wine; she doubts herself constantly, but making wine is where she finds her stride. Jérémie is in a very different position from his siblings since his father-in-law is asking him to sell, saying it would 'keep it in the family'. Jérémie has a hard time dealing with his in-laws throughout the movie and is motivated to sell by the appeal of the thought of finally moving out and getting away from them. In the end I believe it is the moment where his father in law pulls him into the cellar to essentially scold him for Jean not wanting to sell anymore and judges his family for how they 'don't spit' at the party, the judgement of his family seems to be the past straw.

Hi Shianne, 

You did a great job identifying the emotional weight of the letter Jean reads and how it shifts his perspective on the sale.

However, while you discussed Jérémie's conflict with his father-in-law, you missed the timestamp for that specific scene in the cellar. In this Film Question, a specific scene for each sibling needs a timestamp. Additionally, while you correctly spelled the other two siblings' names, you consistently said ""Juliet"" instead of ""Juliette."" In the film essay, it's important to follow the spelling provided in the subtitles or credits. 

Lastly, watch out for minor typos. 

Overall, good work! "
5,"In video 2 at 23:14, the three reminisce on the past that they had within the house. In this particular scene, Jeremie shows Jean a photo of their father with his classmates. He points out that the text next to the photo consists of the names of all of their father's classmates, having been written by Jean. Jean claims to not remember writing it and asks Jeremie to throw the piece of their past away. Jeremie quickly declines this request. They continue to reminisce their childhood, the scene cutting to a young Jean, Jeremie and Juliette in which they try to help Jeremie climb a tree, in which he gets injured. In this flashback, we see that Jean was treated very poorly by his father, in which he found comfort in the arms of his mother. Following this scene we see that Jean continued to have a bad childhood with their father - siding much further to the side of his mother. This scene is an essential one for showcasing how important the land was for the three, having lived their entire childhood on the grounds. However, what I believe is a more important factor here is that the land beneath their feet on which they lived and grew up together all their lives did not strictly provide good feelings - or the filter of happiness that typically accompanies nostalgia when thinking of the past. While Jeremie and Juliette may view their childhood on this land with this filter - only being able to remember the good and happy - Jean is able to reminisce their past on this land in full, seeing the good, the bad, and the ugly. This scene's importance is elevated by understanding that the three do not have shared feelings on the importance of the land and the memories made atop it.",83,"
Hi Christian, 

You offered a thoughtful analysis regarding the ""filter of happiness"" that accompanies nostalgia. 

However, the prompt asked for evidence of attachment to the land/heritage. In the scene you chose, Jean explicitly wants to discard the photo, which suggests a rejection of that heritage rather than an attachment to it. While you argue this proves the land's ""importance,"" a scene that specifically shows his connection to wine-making might have fit the prompt better. 

Also, try to avoid grouping characters (Juliette and Jeremie) without specific evidence for each. 

Finally, please proofread carefully before submitting; you have several grammatical errors. I recommend using Word to prevent them. 

Overall, good work on the analysis! "
5,"I think it is so difficult for Jean and his siblings to sell the vineyard because of the childhood memories tied to it. The siblings feel as if they are betraying their father after he passed away by selling the memories for a quick payout. Even though it would make them instantly rich, they feel as if it is up to them to carry on a legacy through the vineyard. In Video 2 at (8:00-9:45) Jean initially mentions the idea of selling the whole “domain” saying he is in debt and the total sale would be 6 million pounds. That is when Jeremie jumps in and adds why would we sell what mom and dad worked their whole lives for? Showing his first emotion to the thought of selling the vineyard. Juliette also adds she would need a lot more information about his debt before ever considering it. At this point, it is clear Jean is interested in getting his share of what the Vineyard is worth but wants the others to agree. Since they all have a share in the property they must all agree to sell it if so be it. The moment when they are all sat at the table in video 2 (8:00-9:45) the idea is still fresh that the vineyard is worth 6 million pounds, adding that higher tension as they realized they inherited a over 2 million pounds each since they have equal shares. The conversation with the appraiser who said they would only make 1% of the value in production of wine if they decided to continue was also not the most enticing thing to hear. With all that they end up deciding that the memories and legacy of their parents is worth more than the money and they will not sell the vineyards.

Hi Alexander, 

You did a great job identifying the central conflict between financial gain and the emotional weight of the family legacy. 

However, the prompt asked for a scene showing attachment to the land. For Jean, you analyzed a scene where he wants to sell the vineyard to pay his debts. To fully answer the prompt, you should have cited a moment where Jean demonstrates his underlying love for the vineyard. 

Additionally, you have several grammatical errors, mostly related to the use of punctuation. I recommend using Word to prevent them. 

Overall, good work! "
